INTRODUCTION
The Slovak National Centre for Human Rights (hereinafter Centre) has a special position within the organisation of the Slovak society.
It represents an independent legal entity sui generis, which is not entered in the companies register and operates as a non-profit organisation.
As regards the structure of the Report (the selection of the fundamental human rights), we have chosen in the General Part to adhere to the theoretical division of human rights according to their subject, which was - in order to serve our purpose and in places where this might be requested by the character of the inspected right - sometimes combined with the content-based understanding of human rights.
In the Special Part the structure reflects the grounds and areas protected under the AntiDiscrimination Act.
In compliance with the structure defined1, the contents of the Report includes the fundamental human rights and freedoms, the violation or inadequate protection of which stirred sentiments in our society in 2008 and was criticised within public or expert discussion, as well as discriminative actions with focus laid on the grounds and areas protected under anti-discrimination legislation.
Considering the scope of the monitored issue and the limited extent of the report, every chapter shall provide limited general information on guaranteeing rights that are the subject thereof, and the most important international regulation and the national constitutional legislation.
Single Acts or other generally binding legal regulations are listed only in case they were amended in 2008, and influenced the exercise of the monitored rights, or in case it appeared inevitable considering the nature of the monitored right.
While elaborating the Report, the main ambition of the Centre was to offer an objective, true, and topical image of the observance of human rights in the Slovak Republic for the year 2008.
Due to that the Centre asked for cooperation in evaluating the observance of human rights, addressing a number of non-governmental organisations operating in the field of human rights as well as the academic institutions.
The Centre addressed the total of 308 authorities, organisations, and institutions, whereby 152 of them responded in the positive manner and provided the Centre with the requested relevant information.
1 See the Contents.
At the beginning of the year 2009 the Centre entered the 15th year of its existence.
Within the framework of its activities, it has performed a great number of actions aimed at supporting and developing a modern system of human rights protection in the Slovak Republic (research and monitoring of the observance of human rights including the rights of the child, consultancy and aid provided to discrimination victims, consultancy and aid provided in cases of suspected violation of the rights of the child, education activities, enlightenment and prevention in those areas) and submitted many important outputs thereof to the general public.
The most important are the Reports on the Observance of Human Rights in the Slovak Republic.
We therefore believe that the submitted report shall present a contribution not only to the general public, but also foster further development of a system of protection of human rights in Slovakia.
General Part
FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS
1. PERSONAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
Personal rights and freedoms (traditional personality rights) are those fundamental human rights that have been created or formulated in the principal international documents on human rights.
Together with civic and political rights, they constitute the basic pillar of human rights and are historically perceived as first generation rights.
The said rights are understood as the basic normative of the whole international and legal protection of human rights, from which national protection thereof is derived.
In assessing the observance of personality rights and fundamental freedoms in 2008 in the Slovak Republic it is necessary to state again (as was he case in the pervious years) that the Slovak Republic being a standard democratic country guarantees the observance of the international standard of fundamental human rights and that we observed no severe violations thereof.
However, this does not imply that no problems arose in this area, especially in the exercise and enforcement of these rights, or changes that we should draw attention to.
Right to Life
Protection against being deprived of life is granted mainly under the Criminal Code, especially under the Separate Part - Chapter 1 thereof.
The legal regulation criminalising the causing of death to a human being did not change within the monitored period and the number of homicides did not increase dramatically (with 89 homicides in 2007 and 94 committed in 2008), either.
The percentage of clarified cases is around 80 %.
16 homicides were committed by close relatives, whereby 7 of the victims were children.
2. ed. Žilina : Poradca podnikateľa, 2006, p. 149.
In connection with the right to life it is necessary to mention the decision of the European Court of Human Rights (European Court) in the case Furdík against the Slovak Republic.
The claimant objected violation of the Article guaranteeing the right to life, claiming that the state had failed to take measures necessary to protect the life of his daughter who died as a result of injuries suffered while climbing a mountain.
The European Court of Human Rights pronounced the claim inacceptable.
It accepted the opinion of the Government of the Slovak Republic which pronounced it unreal to have such a time limit set out in the legal regulation in question.
4 According to the opinion of the European Court, positive state liability under Article 2 of the Convention does not reach far enough to require an obligation be incorporated in a legal regulation to achieve the adherence to a certain time limit.
In this connection, however, the Centre points out that safeguarding timely and professional care in order to save a persons life is to be considered an inevitable measure to be taken to protect the right to life.
As regards the legislation governing abortion, the situation was not clear in 2008.
This draft, however, was not submitted for negotiation to the National Council of the Slovak Republic by the end of 2008.
Prohibition of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
At international level, the prohibition on torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is enshrined in Article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and similarly under Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and
4 Pirošíková, M.: The Right to Life and Action for the Protection of Personal Rights.
Political Rights.
Observation thereof is safeguarded by the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and similar UN Conventions and Covenants.
In 118 cases the use of violence was not proven on the side of the members of the police, and in the remaining cases investigation is being carried out under legal provisions.
Nine policemen were accused of having committed criminal act of abusing public authority by using violence against the person affected without cause or in an inappropriate manner.
Due to that reason it recommended the claimants to turn to competent authorities and informed them of further possibilities of enforcing their rights.
unwarranted arrest and custody set out by the Act has been observed by the Government.
In connection with the prohibition of on torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment it is necessary to point out that such absolute ban concerns not only the authorities of the police and the Corps of Prison and Court Guard, but all authorities, institutions, and private entities who come in contact with persons deprived (also partially) of personal freedom (for example persons placed in assisted living centres, isolated psychiatric wards, retired homes, geriatric wards, etc.).
Positive liability increases the responsibility of the state for the introduction of measures to prevent inhuman treatment and for consistent investigation of such cases, in case they appear, as well.
It was only on February 27th, 2008 when the Regional Court in Banská Bystrica passed a decision that found the two accused former policemen guilty of his death.
At the same time, the court imposed either suspended or unsuspended sentence on other six former policemen.
In its decision justification the court pointed out that the minimum sentence also reflected the passing of time, whereby the accused were not responsible for the delays.
Considering the fact that the convicts appealed against the decision, it is not valid yet.
According to the newspaper Romano nevo ľil the decision took the family of Karol Sendrei as
well as the civic activists by surprise, as they had expected a higher sentence.
The Mustafa Labsí Cause
Mr. Labsí filed a complained against this decision.
The complaint which Mr. Labsí subsequently filed with the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic objected violation of the fundamental right not to be tortured or subjected to cruel, inhuman
Racisms: 8 years and 6 months for the death and torture of the Roma Karol Sendrei.
9 According to the decision N 175/05 of June 1st, 2005.
The Constitutional Court accepted the complaint on March 13th, 2008 and at the same time delayed the enforceability of the resolution of the Supreme Court on the admissibility of the complainant's extradition as by the day of effect of the decision on the constitutional complaint.
The Constitutional Court stated that the general courts are bound by human right standards also in assessing the admissibility of extradition.
The conditions of the admissibility of extradition (extradition law) are extended by the human rights related condition, the core of which is the wording of the Convention and the case law thereto.
According to the Constitutional Court, the facts stated above result from the irreplaceable role of the courts to protect human freedom from other powers.
At national level, the right to personal freedom is enshrined in Article 17 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
Amended Act Governing the Service of Custody
It sets out the range of rights and freedoms, the exercise of which may be restricted to the accused in custody, or which may not be exercised at all.
This relates mainly to the right to inviolability of person and their privacy, freedom of movement and residence, the observance of inviolability of letters and the inviolability of messages and other documents and the right to choose occupation.
The accused may not exercise some other rights and freedoms while in custody, considering the nature of custody.
This concerns for example the right to strike, the right to form political parties, political movements, trade organisations and associate therein, the right to choose a doctor and a healthcare facility.
As regards correspondence, the amendment altered the rules, granting the right to the accused to receive and send correspondence without restrictions on their own expense.
One of the types of a security company is the security guard service.
The security guard service deals, apart from other services, with the protection of property and person in a public space, outside a public space, or oversees the transport of property or persons and safeguards order at public gatherings of citizens.
Private security services and activities connected thereto are performed by the staff members of the operator who must comply with the conditions set out in the Act governing the performance of private security services.
Persons performing activities and tasks within a private security company governed under the 10 Act No. 507/2001 Coll. on Post Services as amended.
The obligations of private security service companies and their staff members include the obligation to report any intervention performed, as well as the obligation to provide first aid to injured persons.
State surveillance over security service is exercised by the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic and the Regional Directorates of the Police Corps.
Checks may be performed also by the members of the police and municipal police.
Although the Act on Private Security Service delimits exactly the authorisations and obligations of private security companies staff members, there were violations also in 2008.
According to the information that we have at our disposal we should mention one case, where the staff members of a private security company treated a customer in a shopping centre in a harsh and arrogant manner, and searched them in front of other customers, and another case, where they detained and beat a minor boy, whereby it is unfortunately necessary to state that cases of detained minors are not rare.
The Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic, in its response regarding the number and substantiality of complaints on the proceeding of private security staff members, stated that last year there were 11 such complaints filed with the Police Corps, out of which 10 were assessed as unsubstantiated, and one is currently being examined.
What is mentioned above indicates that even if the number of officially filed complaints on the behaviour of private security staff is relatively low, there are unauthorised interferences with the rights of persons present in locations protected by private security companies.
Decision to Establish a Detention Institute in the Psychiatric Clinic in Hronovce
Under § 82 of the Criminal Code the purpose of detention is to place a perpetrator in a detention facility with a specialised therapy regimen and consequent isolation from the society in order to prevent the perpetrator from committing further crime.
According to a statement by the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic patients with a broad spectrum of psychiatric diagnoses may be placed in a detention facility in case their behaviour qualifies them to be placed in detention.
The diagnoses in question mostly include personality disorders, behavioural disorders, and adaptation disorders.
The capacity of the suggested detention facility shall comprise 36 rooms.
Project documentation was elaborated based on the underlying documents provided by the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic, the Corps of Prison and Court Guard of the Slovak Republic and on the opinion of the head expert of the said Ministry in the field of psychiatry.
The construction of the detention facility is expected to take approximately 18 months; however, it shall be commenced depending on the date of public procurement finalisation and the selection of the construction
Under Article 17 paragraph 5 of the Constitution a person can be taken into custody only due to reasons and for a period defined by law and on the basis of a court ruling.
A person is taken into custody to make sure they appear before the court for the hearing, and are prevented from committing further criminal acts and from obstructing the collection of evidence.
However, custody does not represent punishment for the committed deed and it is therefore necessary to respect the benefit of the doubt also in case of a person in custody.
In compliance with the international as well as the national regulation it is the obligation of the general courts to see to it that the custody period does not exceed the necessary time.
The prosecutor is obliged to free the accused person at the latest by the last day of the seven month of custody in the pre-trial period, in case legal action is not taken, at least twenty working days prior to the lapsing of this period, or a proposal is made on the agreement on guilt and punishment, or a proposal is made to the pre-trial judge to prolong the period.
Similarly the court of the pre-trial judge has to decide on the custody or the proposal of the prosecutor to prolong the custody period so that in case a complaint is filed against the decision of the court, the file is submitted to the higher instance court at the latest within five working days prior to the lapsing of the period which would be the custody period in the pre-trial or prior to the lapsing of the custody within the pre-trial.
The higher instance court shall decide within the period, which would be the custody period in pre-trial, or the period which should be prolonged, otherwise the head of the senate of the higher instance court is to release the person accused.
Trafficking in Human Beings
On February 1st, 2008 the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings came into effect.
According to the statistics of the Office to Combat Organised Crime of the Presidium of the Police Corps, 11 crimes of trafficking in human beings under § 179 Criminal Act were reported, whereby 5 of them were clarified in 2008.
The overall number of trafficking victims was 13, with 11women and 2 men.
The percentage of clarified cases amounted to 45.5 %.
Violence against Women
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic the total number of 497 cases of crime of torture of a close relative under § 208 of the Criminal Act was recorded in 2008.
Out of those 312 were clarified, that means charges were pressed.
An important step in the fight against domestic violence in 2008 was the amendment of some Acts governing this issue.
The period of 48 hours is considered insufficient by some non-governmental organisations active in this field due to the time necessary to take steps to protect domestic violence victims.
In the field of violence against women the non-governmental organisations pointed out a number of positive changes in legislation, but also some bottlenecks.
May 2008 ended the national campaign titled “Stop Domestic Violence against Women” which was carried out under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic.
Within the campaign several information brochures were published aimed at various target groups and cooperating professions.
An important source of information about the campaign was the newly created website www.zastavmenasilie.sk, radio and TV spots, and billboards urging people to zero tolerance of violence against women.
Important research in this area was performed by the Institute for Labour and Family Research
Right to Maintain Dignity, Honour, Reputation and Good Name
The aim of protecting human dignity is defined within present day Slovak legislation as protection from such kind of treatment which degrades the dignity of an individual as a human being.
This type of protection is provided at the national level predominantly by means of criminal and civil law.
Both of them are oriented towards protection from other forms of violation of these rights.
Criminal Law fosters predominantly the protection of sexual dignity, and Civil Law is the pillar of protection from offence, calumny, slander and other verbal acts defaming the dignity, honour, reputation or good name of a person.
It is therefore inevitable in the framework of the international as well as national legislation, but mainly within the exercise of the freedom of speech, to consequently protect other personality rights including the right to maintain human dignity, personal honour, reputation, and good name.
Open
good name takes the form of biased and stereotypical information provided by the media on ethnic and other minorities.
The democratic and political system and the independence of the media in Slovakia allow for and safeguard the exercise of the freedom of speech and the right to information.
An important aspect of the freedom of speech and the right to information is the protection against the abuse thereof.
In 2008 the Council for Broadcasting and Retransmission recorded no complaints in relation to the provision of biased information on national minorities by other citizens.
It is evident that biased and distorted information concerning minorities was provided by the media also in 2008.
The trend is still observable in the society of providing stereotypical information on some national minorities.
There are efforts observed in a number of especially private media, to write in tabloid style about topics in connection with the Roma ethnic minority.
The way of presenting this minority and the related topics is biased, distortive and generalising in many cases.
This trend influences the persistence and rooting of prejudice in the society, which may result in social exclusion of some Roma citizens or even whole communities.
In 2008 the media dealt into great extent with the relation between Slovaks and Hungarians.
In this connection there was a number of disparaging statements uttered by the representatives of the Slovak National Party and other parties as well.
In 2008 the Council for Broadcasting and Retransmission recorded one claim objecting “mockery and offence of the homosexual minority”.
The Council for Broadcasting and Retransmission decided that the complaint was unsubstantiated.
It would be therefore advisable in this respect to emphasize better observance of the Code of Ethics by the media employees and alleviate the tabloid journalism when writing about “hot topics” (such as the Roma, homosexuals, etc.), and to foster multiethnic, multinational and multicultural dialogue within the society also by offering more space in the media.
Freedom of Movement and Residence
The freedom of movement and residence being one of the fundamental human rights is guaranteed under Article 23 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, whereby paragraph 3 sets out the reasons due to which this right may be limited.
This includes a case where state security, public order, and the protection of health or the rights and freedoms of other persons must be safeguarded, including the protection of nature in delimited territories.
The most important legal regulation of the freedom of movement within the EU is Title III of the Treaty Establishing of the European Communities - Free movement of persons, services, and capital, which guarantees the free movement of workers within the Communities.
Article 18 of the said Treaty introduces the right of a citizen of the EU to move and reside freely in the territories of the member states, whereby they are subject to the restrictions and conditions governed under the treaty and measures adopted for their enforcement.
The enforcement of the right to free movement and stay within the territory of EU member states by EU citizens and their relatives is governed by European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.
This Directive represents one of the fundamental internal market freedoms.
It guarantees free movement of persons and creates an area without internal borders where freedom is safeguarded in compliance with the provisions of Treaty Establishing the European Communities.
Slovak Republic within the Schengen Area
The effort of the Slovak Republic to become a member of the Schengen area was crowned with success in December 2007.
By acceding to the Schengen area Slovak citizens could actually start exercising one of the fundamental freedoms granted to EU citizens, namely the right to free movement of persons.
Free movement of persons includes the right to travel freely from one country to another and also chose a country in which they want to settle down and live.
Once having crossed the internal borders, the citizens are no longer obliged to produce a passport or an identification card.
Free movement of persons within a single area that the European Union has been creating since its establishment is thus recognised as a fundamental right of its citizens.
Experience from 2008 has shown that the implementation of this principle in practice was more demanding than the implementation of the rules governing free movement of capital, goods, and services.
Free movement of persons within the Schengen area including the Slovak Republic since the end of 2007 has inevitably required the introduction of compensation measures on external frontiers.
That means that the Slovak Republic being a subject responsible for the control of borders to another country is to automatically safeguard not only its own security but also the security of other EU member states.
In 2008 a Schengen information system was established, which functions not only as a common search and information system to combat crime, but also as one of the most important preconditions to implement important procedures in connection with common visa and asylum policies and issues related to arms and ammunition, judiciary cooperation, and criminal suits.
It works as a compensatory measure to safeguard safety within the Schengen area.
The International Organisation for Migration in cooperation with the Council of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Crime Prevention and regional authorities in Košice and Prešov in 2008 carried out an information campaign on the consequences of Schengen accession in the districts bordering with Ukraine.
We have asked the Border and Aliens' Police Office of the Ministry of Interior to provide us with their understanding of the recorded limitations, or violations of the right to free movement of persons.
According to the statement of the Border and Aliens' Police Office of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic since the accession of the Slovak Republic to Schengen area no serious threat to public order and internal security was recorded within the Slovak Republic, due to which the Slovak Republic has until now adopted no measure to reintroduce temporary control over the internal borders in compliance with the Schengen Borders Code.
Having assessed al factors we may conclude that the accession to the Schengen area brought to the citizens to the Slovak Republic many advantages in the field of human rights and freedoms, especially better safety and prevention of illegal activities in the field of migration, drug trafficking and trafficking in various commodities.
New Act on Travel Documents
documents and to start applying it in practice.
An obligation arose to the Slovak Republic to introduce biometric data including the image of the face and fingerprints within the determined period.
Competent authorities thus required a written approval from the applicant of the other parent, or the presence of the other parent or claimed that the application be only submitted by the mother of the minor.
24 Response of Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic of March 16th, 2009 , ref.: PPZ-164-11/KA-2009.
Right to Privacy
At international level the right to privacy is guaranteed especially under Article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
It is only the case law and decision making practice that defines them.
In its assessment of the right to privacy the European Court dealt with the protection of phone conversations, gathering and keeping of personal data, the right to the protection of home, domestic freedom, correspondence etc..
Amended Act on Electronic Communications - Obligation of Mobile Operators to Enable
By adopting the amendment, the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council 2006/24/EC on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communication services or of public communications networks was transposed into Slovak legislation.
Among the data that the operators providing telecommunication and internet services are to keep is the length and time of phone calls, localisation of the communication participant and their identification data.
The data must be kept by the operator for the period of six months in case of internet communication and one year in case of other communication.
The requirements for the keeping of data do not relate to the contents of the communication itself.
The data may be required by law enforcement authorities, courts, prosecutors offices, customs administration or intelligence services based on a decision issued by the court at all times.
In 2008 the media stirred a discussion in connection with the entering of this Act into effect, regarding the obligation to keep operation and localisation data on communication participants.
The Ministry has informed us that no problems arose in connection with the implementation of this amendment and no complaints were recorded based thereon.
The statistical data provided to the Ministry of Transport by single operators reads that in 2008 there were 319 cases of providing requested data and 65 cases in which the requested data was not provided.
Decision of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic on the Right to Privacy
In connection with the right to privacy the decision that stirred sentiments in the society in 2008 was the decision issued by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic of May 28th, 2008 in connection with a complaint dealing with eavesdropping from 9 years ago.
The eavesdropping was performed based on three decisions of the Regional Court in Banská Bystrica26 in connection with inspecting into the criminal activity of the complainant's husband.
The objected decisions included brief reasoning, which the Constitutional Court considered insufficient and formal, since they failed to explain to the complainant the context and circumstance of the violation of her right to privacy.
Based on what has been stated above, the Constitutional Court considered the objected decisions of the regional court unsubstantiated and illegal despite the fact that the Act on the Police Corps in the relevant time did not explicitly enshrine the obligation of the court judge to justify their decision.
Registered Partnership
Although Slovak legislation explicitly bans discrimination against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation (Anti-Discrimination Act), it is only a ban in certain areas governed by law; such as the labour market, education, social security, healthcare provision and provision of goods and services.
At national level the right to own property is governed under Article 20 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
Highways
31 Situation as to April 1st, 2008.
The regional building authority only considers the requirements of the parties to the planning proceedings, which relate to the construction of highways and motorways.
In this connection a transitory provision was adopted (§ 142b), under which the planning proceedings in connection with the construction under § 117b, that were commenced before December 13th, 2008 shall be terminated according to regulations valid until that date.
The resolution of the Government of the Slovak Republic (No. 882 of December 3rd, 2008 and No. 75 of January 21st, 2009) related to the adoption of PPP and evaluation of offers submitted by the applicants.
Forced restriction of the right to property was recorded in 850 cases in 2008.
Similarly to the cases of expropriation and forced restriction of the right to property was performed in an inevitable extent, in public interest, in compliance with the law and for an appropriate compensation.
The NHS did not record any case of expropriation in private law in the year 2008.
The Issue of Flat Rental Regulation
The issue of regulated rental in houses which possession has been recovered in Slovakia affects approximately 3 % of the housing fund.
There are opposite opinions in the society regarding flat rental regulation.
Owners of houses (restitutees and owners) are obliged to keep their property in an operable state.
The regulated rental does not allow them to invest resources into necessary maintenance and reconstruction of their immovable property, and fails to consider the economically eligible cost and an appropriate gain.
The solution to this problem is not only an issue for the owners of the houses but also of the state, guaranteeing support to those who are socially disadvantaged, since the state must be ready for the transition to market environment and must have at its disposal a certain amount of social flats to solve cases which cannot be solved in other ways.
The Ministry of Construction and Regional Development of the Slovak Republic submitted in February 2008 to government discussion a draft law regulation of those relationships titled “Draft Act on the Termination of Certain Rental Relations as amended”, in which the issue of flat rental price regulation is treated.
The Government of the Slovak Republic discussed the Act on March 5th, 2008, whereby it failed to adopt the proposed solution and asked the Ministry of Construction and Regional Development of the Slovak Republic to elaborate and submit for negotiation with the Government by March 31st, 2009 a new concept which shall tackle the ways of governing the relations between the private owners of flat-buildings and the tenants affected by rental deregulation based on measurable social criteria.
Under this measure the maximum price of flat rental after December 2011 shall be used only in case certain conditions are met.
A different legal regimen shall affect houses procured from public resources and those procured without using such resources.
The said Ministry published the form on their website for the period from October 1st, 2008 to December 31st, 2008.
According to the statement of the Ministry 887 tenants applied within the given period, whereby their number increased to 1000 by now.
The Ministry does not have the data on the exact number of owners of the houses in question.
The interference of the state with the rights and freedoms of individuals is admissible in protecting an important state interest, under the condition that proportionality be respected between the usage of tools and the goal to be achieved.
The goal in this case is the protection of tenants via price regulation from real or possible market effects.
The regulation of rental prices in place is perceived as a limitation of contractual freedom by the owners of the houses which possession has been recovered.
In any case such
intervention by the state ought to have a time limitation.
The proposed conceptual solution expects that the issue be solved in the course of the forthcoming five years following the adoption of the legal regulation of the proposal.
2. CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS AND RIGHTS OF ALIENS
Civil and political rights together with personal (personable) rights are traditionally considered first generation human rights.
At national level, these rights are governed under the third section of Chapter II Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
The provisions of the said section Constitution reflect the democratic basis of the Slovak Republic, which shows in the plurality-based political system, and the briefly expressed
The Right to Vote
The electoral right includes the right to vote, to elect (active electoral right) and the right to be elected (passive electoral right).
The active electoral right represents one form of participation in the administration of public affairs and the passive electoral right is part of the right of access to the positions of public officials.
At international level these rights are governed under Article 3 of the Supplementary Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, under Articles 39 and 40 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as well as Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
The right to participate in the administration of public affairs via free election is at present governed under 5 separate law acts,36 which govern some obstacles in the exercise of the right to vote in a different manner.

Republic.
Considering the extraordinary importance of the right to vote for the existence and functioning of a democratic society, the Centre recommends that the “electoral” legislation be unified and that the active electoral right be granted to all citizens of the Slovak Republic (regardless of their momentary whereabouts (by allowing our citizens to vote at Slovak embassies).
In 2008, the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic decided on 39 electoral complaints regarding municipal elections held in December 2006 and about 2 electoral complaints regarding municipal elections held in the village of v Perín-Chym on October 27th, 2007 and March 15th, 2008.
This precondition was not met in case the electoral committee in villages allowed some citizens to vote for their relatives while electing the mayor, despite the fact that one of the committee members made them aware that such acting was not in compliance with the law.
Participation of Women in Public Administration
The Slovak Republic, being a member state of the European Union, is obliged to respect the gender equality principle in the creation of all policies.
Decision of the Constitutional Court PL.
ÚS 32/07-32
Despite the relevant legislation and undisputed effort of the engaged state administration authorities we must repeatedly conclude that the low participation of women of Slovakia in all spheres of public power was reality also in 2008.
This status quo is really far away from the plan of the European Union to establish and increase gender equality - with not less than 40 % to 60 % gender representation ratio.
At present day participation of women comprises 20 % in the National Council of the Slovak Republic, 6.2% in the Government (which makes us together with Romania (0 %) and Cyprus (8 %) one of the countries with the lowest percentage of women participating in the executive).
The ratio of female representatives in regional authorities comprises 14.3 %, there is no woman heading a selfgoverning region and there is a 20.7% representation of female mayors of towns and villages on local level.
In 2008 there was no female lord mayor of a regional capital and the ratio of female representatives in town councils of regional capitals ranged from 12 % in the town of Trenčín to 27.5 % in the capital of Bratislava.
The only exception is the ratio of women representing Slovakia in the European Parliament, with 5 females out of 14 representatives, which is 35.7 %.
Despite the fact that some parliament parties do have associations of women and their statutes declare observance of gender equality principles, these are not applied in reality.
The ratio of female candidates is less than one third.
From what has been stated above we conclude that the representation of women in public administration is insufficient and it is desirable that our political parties take advantage of foreign experience in next elections and increase the numbers of women in their ranks.
Women are not adequately represented either in the governance of the basic economic and infrastructure sectors in Slovakia.
On the other hand it is necessary to state that for example the administration of the National Labour Inspectorate is performed by 83 % women and in the judiciary system 56 % of the Supreme Court judges are women and we also have a female Head of the Constitutional Court.
Participation of Minority Representatives in Public Governance
The right to participate in the administration of public matters is one of the fundamental rights of national minorities.
This part of our last report dealt with the participation of minority representatives dealt with their representation on the level of the parliament, municipal self-governance, and higher territorial units.
40 Because no elections into the mentioned authorities were held in 2008, the number of representatives of our minorities has not changed, whereby the most represented minority on various levels of public administration is the Hungarian minority, partially thanks to their number.
The composition of the Council of the Government for National Minorities and Ethnic Groups has also remained the same.
In 2008 the said Council held three meetings.
40 For more information see the Report on the Observance of Human Rights in the Slovak Republic for 2007.
Bratislava : Slovak National Centre for Human Rights, 2008, p. 34.
It is natural in a classic democratic society for the citizens to have direct influence on making decisions about public matters or to directly participate in the decision making process itself.
That is why we have decided to concentrate on the level of civic participation in regional capitals and selected towns around our republic.
To our question, whether general public or representatives thereof were invited to participate in the elaboration of concepts, plans and policies and whether their comments were taken into consideration in compliance with the rules on safeguarding participation of citizens in the administration of public matters and decisions related to them, all addressed towns replied that the public and its representatives had possibilities and opportunities to participate in the elaborations of the documents in question.
To give us examples, they named those draft concepts, plans, and programmes elaborated and adopted during the past few years or prepared at present.
The town of Považská Bystrica prepared an Economic Development Plan, Zoning Plan, General Building Scheme of Transport, General Building Scheme of Greenery.
The town of Trnava also elaborated an Economic and Social Development Plan, Housing Policy Concept, Zoning Plan, and a Local Ecological Stability Plan.
The town of Trenčín elaborated an Economic and Social Development Plan with the participation of public, and the town of Banská Bystrica is elaborating their Community Plan of Social Services in a similar manner.
The response also included a detailed overview of those decisions, concepts, plans and programmes, the creation of which included the participation of general public in a certain scope.
Town councils in single towns have advisory bodies consisting of town representatives, selected representatives of the general public and experts.
The meetings of town councils, as the towns have affirmed, are open to general public and every citizen has the right to attend.
The Magistrate of the Capital of Bratislava described the participation of the citizens/inhabitants in tow council meetings as follows.
“The public has the right to attend the meetings of our council and asked for the possibility to speak to any of the points.
The towns informed us, that public gatherings (public meetings) are organised at the time of creating strategic documents and passing decisions, including the towns of Pezinok, Poprad, Považská Bystrica, Trnava, and Banská Bystrica.
In order to inform general public, single towns use noticeboards at town offices, bulletin boards in the offices of city part boards, local press (weeklies, monthlies), local TV stations, websites, e-mails sent to citizens, and regular meetings of the town representatives (mayors and town council members) with general public.
To our question, into which extent the remarks of the citizens are taken into consideration in the process of elaborating documents and passing decisions, the towns responded that the level of acceptance of those remarks by legal and natural entities varies.
The Magistrate of the Capital of Bratislava stated that “...decisions made by the representatives have been changed a couple of times under the pressure exerted by the public or the media, for example the prices of tombs and the like ”.
The town of Poprad cooperates with the public as much as possible and public remarks are considered while considering the concept materials.
The town of Trnava accepts the incentives of the general public and evaluates them subsequently.
The town of Žilina also takes such remarks into consideration and the general public participates in the decision making process.
The town of Prešov includes substantiated remarks or suggestions in the submitted materials.
Apart from that “what is specific for the town of Prešov is the monthly meetings of the city part boards in the presence of the towns representatives and general public as well as the representatives of the municipal authority.
A minutes is being made of every such meeting including the remarks, requirements and suggestions made by the citizens”.
In 2008 however, there were cases that stirred sentiments in the society, of possible violation of the right of the general public to participate in public administration.
In this connection, the Centre focused on issues related with the increasing density of buildings on housing estates and addressed the Magistrate of the Capital of Bratislava separately, asking questions about the reconstruction of the Old Bridge.
In his opinion, free spaces on housing estates ought to be utilised in a more practical manner, for example for increasing job possibilities, improving the condition of the greenery, and of the housing environment.
Citizens had a possibility to find out about the intent of the capital at the meeting of the towns representatives and also in the media.
From the point of view of civil law it is possible to point out the decision of the capital to organise a public voting regarding the future appearance of the reconstructed Old Bridge, which was clearly above the framework of their obligations.
After the voting, however, according to the statement of the capitals representatives, there was a group of citizens who wanted to have the original appearance of the bridge preserved as an architectural monument and requests made by architects who wanted to intervene in the reconstruction itself.
Based on such opinions among the general public represented by a few civic associations, and based on opinions submitted by experts in statics, the capitals representatives decided to change their mind and repair the Old Bridge, preserving its original appearance.
One of the major factors influencing this decision was the financial crisis that limited the financial resources of the capital as regards the said reconstruction.
The Ombudsman did not make use of this facultative right.
41 Finally, the Constitutional Court accepted the claim filed by 42 representatives of the National Council of the Slovak Republic on September 26th, 2008 regarding the reassessment of the constitutionality of some of its decisions.
In connection with the impacts of the new Press Act, the Centre addressed the Slovak Syndicate of Journalists and the Association of Regional Press Publishers of Slovakia.
Although the Association perceives the Press Act as it has been passed in a negative way, it stated in its response that as far as real-life impacts of this Act on regional and local press are considered, no “abuse of the Press Act by citizens, companies or politicians has occurred”, and that only a small number of responses was received, causing no serious trouble.
As regards the evaluation of the press in Slovakia in 2008, according to the Annual report of the international organisation Freedom House this is guaranteed under the constitution and generally respected.
The report on last year the adoption of a new Press Act is mentioned, which met with criticism among those fostering freedom of press, objecting lack of transparency of ownership relations in this field.
Despite the generally positive evaluation of the manifested freedom of speech not only as regards the influence of the media in Slovakia, there were single cases of abuse of this freedom, that were being dealt with in this Report, especially the right to observance of human dignity, personal honour, reputation and goodwill, as it deals with the manifestations of extremism, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and defamation of nation, race and belief.
In connection with the conditions of the enjoyment of the right to information in the last year it is necessary to mention the amended Act No. 211/2000 Coll. on Free Access to Information.
Response of the Ombudsman of March 16th, 2009, ref.:1429/09/KVOP.
As regards the enjoyment of the right to information by the citizens of the Slovak Republic, there were single cases of its violation last year.
In their Report on the Activities in 2008, the Ombudsman stated that in seven cases that there was proven violation of the right to information, whereby they pointed out 4 cases of violation of this right by municipalities.
The enforcement of this right faced an unclear interpretation of and application of the law last year.
This was also perceivable in the response of42 Transparency International Slovakia.
In the period mentioned above, the suggestions of the citizens objected unwillingness on the side of the persons obliged to enable access to information, for example by pretending personal data protection, in case information was requested from persons which have this obligation limited etc.
Right to Petition
The Right to Petition is governed under Article 27 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
Everybody has the right to turn either alone, or together with other people to state authorities or selfgovernance authorities with suggestions, proposals or complaints related to public matters or in issues of common interest.
A petition, however, must not incite or instigate violation of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic or Slovak law, deny or limit personal, political or other rights of citizens on the grounds of their nationality, sex, race, origin, political or other views, religion or belief, or social status.
A petition must not instigate hate, intolerance leading to violence or rude behaviour.
Signatures may be collected by an individual of at least 16 years of age.
A public administration authority with which this petition was submitted is obliged to accept and deal with it in case it has the competences to do so.
The result is to be made public by the authority in the course of 30 days following the acceptance thereof.
In a democratic state, a petition is understood as some form of feedback, which is important for political power.
In 2008 violation of the petition right was not objected in the Slovak Republic.
Petitions in 2008
In such cases, the referendum must be called by the president of the Slovak Republic and 350 thousand signatures must be collected, which was not the case.
The contents of a petition may vary, which is shown on the example of a petition filed by some inhabitants of the town of Medzilaborce against their Roma fellow citizens.
Despite the fact that the petition did not contain all necessities and failed to show compliance with the Act on the Right to Petition, it was being dealt with by the town police.
A Roma family was not let in a block of flats, which is now being investigated by the court and the police.
Another activity that stirred sentiments among general public was the one of the Life Forum (Fórum života) association which was collecting signatures to fight discrimination against unborn children on the basis of their genetic impairment.
By that, Fórum života reacted to the amended Abortion Act prepared by the Ministry of Health.
All signatures, including those collected in Slovakia, were supposed to be submitted to the UN, the Olympic Committee and to organisations active in the field of human rights.
An unsuccessful petition activity was observed in the town of Poprad, where parents protested against the closing of one of the elementary schools.
The petition for the adoption of the Agreement between the Slovak Republic and the Holy See on Conscientious Objection collected more than 100 thousand signatures.
One of the petitions supported, and the other rejected the plan.
Discrimination resulting from the permanent stay in the border aria was experienced by the inhabitants of the region of Ubľa on the border with Ukraine, on the grounds of which they filed a petition.
The adopted new Customs Act made the conditions of purchasing goods by those who travel to Ukraine from the region of 15 km from the border stricter.
There are strict limits imposed on the inhabitants of this region, which do not apply to other Slovak citizens.
The Constitutional Court has not decided on this merits so far.
Among other unsatisfied citizens were those who gave up their land to the construction of the tunnel Branisko, receiving no compensation from the state.
Their activity was partially successful, as some of the petitioners already received a part of their money.
Right to Peaceful Assembly and Freedom of Association
The right to peaceful assembly and the freedom of association are considered first generation rights and are listed among political rights, and relate closely to the freedom of speech.
At international level, the right to assembly and associate is guaranteed under Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Articles 21 and 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as Article 12 of the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights of the European Union.
At national level, this right is guaranteed under Articles 28 and 29 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
The right to peaceful assembly and association is at the same time the basic right for the enjoyment of the freedom of speech and the right to information or the right to participate in the administration of public matters and other constitutional rights and freedoms.
A violation of the right to assembly was objected last year by the Centre for Reform in Bioethics in Košice, which filed with the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic to start legal action against the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic due to an unlawful practice of the police.
The unlawful practice included the collection of panels with pictures of aborted foetuses.
In connection with the right to peaceful assembly and the freedom of association the issues becoming topical of the abuse of these two by various groups which support ideologies suppressing human rights and fundamental freedoms and that disguise extremist motives.
We shall deal with this issue into more detail in Chapter 6.
Act on Associations
In February, at the meeting of the Council of the Slovak Republic for Non-governmental nonprofit Organisations, at which the Minister of the Interior participated in person, an ad hoc working group was formed following the proposal of the represented non-governmental organisations, consisting of third sector representatives, which was supposed to intensely cooperate with the Interior Ministry during the process of drafting the Act on Associations.
Under Article 53 of the Constitution, Slovak Republic grants asylum to aliens persecuted due to their enjoyment of political rights and freedoms.
Act No. 643/2007 Coll., amending Act No. 480/2002 on Asylum as amended.
Act No. 451/2008 Coll., amending Act No. 480/2002 on Asylum as amended.
This service is safeguarded by the Centre for Legal Assistance.
Granting Asylum in Practice
Based on the statistics of the Migration Office of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic (Migration Office ) we may state that the number of asylum seekers shows a decreasing tendency.
The percentage of unaccompanied minors was 7.8 %.
The structure of asylum seekers according to the country of origin reflected the military conflict in Georgia.
Out of the total number of 2643 applicants in 2007, asylum was granted to 14 asylum seekers, which is 0.52 %, supplementary protection was granted to 82 applicants (3.10 %).
Another contribution observed in 2008 was the possibility of asylum seekers to ask to be represented in the appellate proceedings by the Centre for Legal Assistance.
In the course of December 2008 16 applicants turned to the said centre.
In 3 cases proceedings were initiated on the right to appeal against the decision made by the Migration Office, however, none of them were finalised in 2008.
Applicants address the Centre by filing their applications on a specialised form via the Migration Office of the Slovak Republic.
Interpreting services are provided by the staff of the Centre (English) or interpreting and translating agencies.
The Centre cooperates with nongovernmental organisations (Slovak Humanitarian Council, League for Human Rights) as well as with UNHCR.
The Process of Integrating Migrants
The key point of responsible migration policy is the process of integrating those who were granted asylum into the society.
The resolution introduced tasks for the Migration Office of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic, the vice Prime Minister of the Government of the
In order to facilitate the process of integration into the society, asylum seekers have a chance to attend a Slovak language course during their stay in the integration centre and later as well, supported by the resources provided from the European Social Fund.
The League for Human Rights carried out two projects: Legal Assistance in Asylum Proceedings in the territory of the Slovak Republic and Asylum Clinic II.
The Community of People of Good Will carried out a project in cooperation with the Slovak Humanity Council, the aim of which was to introduce a unified system of assistance provided to asylum seekers and persons under supplementary protection in the process of their integration.
While carrying out the said project, the Community of People of Good Will focused on the main pillars supporting the prices of integration - speaking Slovak, and having a permanent stay and a decent job in the period of primary (1 year) and secondary integration (3 years).
Based on experience, the Community of People of Good Will stated that there was progress in integration policy in the Slovak Republic, with an acute problem observed in the mechanism of granting citizenship, which is too lengthy in their opinion.
Response of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic of 16th, 2009, ref.: MU-127/2009.
These measures are aimed at further harmonisation of the legal status of a alien living in the territory of the Slovak Republic legally for long-term to the status of a Slovak citizen and contribute to systematic protection of the rights of aliens.
56 In elaborating the draft integration measures the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic used the analyses of the status, needs, and problems of aliens living in the Slovak Republic as well as the experience and appropriate and proven methods used in other EU member states.
Historically, fundamental human rights and freedoms include economic, social, and cultural rights and are considered second generation of human rights.
Considering the subject protected by those rights, they represent a group of rights the scope and safeguarding of which depend predominantly on the economic possibilities of the state and which may be applied or restricted only within the scope of special legislation.
The issue of social rights in legal and occupational relations connects not only with an ethical but also a political aspect.
The influence of these factors is best reflected in the perception of the fundamental right to equitable and adequate working conditions declared in Article 36 of the Constitution, especially the right to appropriate pay for the work performed.

the right to collective bargaining.
The right to equitable and adequate working conditions is preconditioned by the existence of a legal and occupational relation and is granted to all employees (regardless of their citizenship).
From the legal point of view it is important that the said fundamental rights may only be claimed within the framework of law enforced by these provisions59.
In order to enforce this group of rights declared in the Constitution “enforcement" acts are necessary,60 which constitute the legal claim to claim the fundamental right (for example the Labour Code, the Act on Safety and Health Protection at Work, Minimum Wages Act and others).
The Functioning of Tripartite61 in 2008
The functioning of tripartite in 2008 was marked mainly by differing opinions of the representatives of employers and the representatives of employees on the increase in minimum wages.
Throughout the year, the Republic Union of Employers objected several times a breach of the rules of social dialogue.
For example during the negotiation on the increase in minimum wages and extending the articles of association of higher degree or the transposition of the Revised Social Charter into Slovak legal order.
60 See: Drgonec, J.: The Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
Commentary.
62 TRIPARTITE.
Social partners in conflict due to new negotiation rules.
In the opinion of the Confederation of Trade Unions of the Slovak Republic, this caused the “unbalanced” representation of social partners, where apart from the ministers representing the government and the representatives of the Confederation of Trade Unions of the Slovak Republic, the Republic Union of Employers was represented only by executive secretaries at the meeting held on September 27th.
At the meeting of the Economic and Social Council of the Slovak Republic held on October 27th, 2008 one of the 5 issues on the agenda was the proposal to ratify the European Social Charter (revised) of the Council of Europe from 1996.
The consent was missing, however, on the side of the employers - the Republic Union of Employers and the Federation of Employers' Associations of the Slovak Republic.
A new agenda was adopted by the Economic and Social Council of the Slovak Republic in February 2009.
In: Informačný spravodajca KOZ, No. 50, November 3rd, 2008, p. 2.
f=669a0acda398938fe449a48d3b8bc22f.
Economic and Social Council of the Slovak Republic, which roofs the regular meetings of the social partners, only presidents, vice-presidents, chairs and deputy chairs of employers and employees associations or member unions may become members thereof.
New Minimum Wages Act
According to the former Act, they were entitled to minimum wages with a lowered rate (50 % and 75 % of the minimum wages).
This fact was pointed out previously by a number of subjects focusing on the protection of rights of persons with disabilities.
The most prominent change in connection with the adoption of this Act was the introduction of a new procedure of adjusting minimum wages, according to which the amount of monthly minimum wages and hourly minimum wages is set annually by regulation of the government of the Slovak Republic for the period of the relevant calendar year.
An employer acting in compliance with the Labour Code in remunerating may negotiate with trade union representatives a higher amount of minimum wages (higher than the amount set by the regulation of the government).
In case there are no active representatives of trade unions active on the side of the employer, the employer may provide so by their own decision.
While adjusting the amount of monthly minimum wages under the Act the overall economic and social situation in the Slovak Republic must be taken into consideration for the previous calendar years.
65 The Tripartite has new negotiation rules.
66 Act No. 90/1996 Coll. on Minimum Wages as amended.
Employees in the Companies Owned by Foreign Investors in Slovakia and their Rights
and Working Conditions
The entrepreneurs operating in Slovakia also include foreign investors.
Apart from the fact that they foster a competitive environment, they also help create new jobs and develop those regions of our country that are lagging behind.
A number of foreign investors come from countries with different economic, cultural, and working habits.
In the field of legal and occupational relations this may be reflected especially in a different understanding of social rights of employees.
In 2008, the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs, and the Family recorded no complaint filed by an employee objecting failure to adhere to human rights and unsuitable working conditions provided by foreign companies operating in Slovakia.
No suggestion was recorded objecting the violation of the principle of equal treatment in labour and occupational relations and similar legal relations in relation with the Anti-Discrimination Act.
Based on the information provided by the control units of the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs, and the Family and from the knowledge gained while performing control activities at the offices of Labour, Social Affairs, and the Family it is obvious that most discrimination elements on the side of the employers are of latent nature and very difficult to prove.
This concerns particularly discrimination during job recruitment or layoff due to high age, pregnancy and membership in the Roma ethnicity.
According to the knowledge of the Confederation of Trade Unions of the Slovak Republic a number of foreign employers prevent the establishment of trade organisations at their workplaces, and influence employees, refuse to join collective negotiations and obstruct the making of collective labour agreements.
Some employers do not pay the negotiated wages within the negotiated deadlines, make them work extra hours exceeding the set limit, and pay them no extra money under the provisions of the Labour Code, and also refuse to provide them with protective gear and arbitrarily change the labour consumption standards.
According to the findings of the National Labour Inspectorate, the employers usually forget to duly inform the employees of the principle of equal treatments and the provisions thereof.
Internal measures adopted to prevent discrimination and internal rules to safeguard adherence to the provisions of equal treatment in the majority of foreign employers operating in our country are absent.
There also is a Council of Employees with representatives elected from among and by the employees.
The representatives thereof interpret the requirements of the employees to the employer.
job, the employees are informed of the internal rules and regulations and the organisation and work order.
The company has a special department for the settlement of disputes which operates as an internal mediator, examines suggestions and settles disputes that arise at the workplace by means of agreement.
Following the suggestions made by its clients, the Centre decided to gain information in 2008 on the observation of appropriate working conditions in selected companies owned by some foreign investors.
Many employees are afraid to lose their jobs and therefore unwilling to point out the lacks on the side of the employer and prefer to remain in anonymity, which makes it difficult to inspect into the suggestions and subsequently improve the conditions.
What is a negative and quite frequently occurring phenomenon on the side of the employer is the sanctioning of employees who file a complaint either directly in the company or with the competent institutions, by terminating the employment due to “breach of working discipline
Many foreign investors operating in Slovakia do not have sufficient knowledge of our labour and anti-discrimination legislation.
It would be appropriate in this connection if the state and non-governmental organisations paid more attention to increasing awareness as regards anti-discrimination and labour law on the side of both employers and employees.
Mobbing, Bossing, and Bullying
Mobbing, bossing, and bullying are forms of unacceptable behaviour at work, forbidden under the legal order of the Slovak Republic.
Mobbing, bossing, and bullying are often identified in employer companies that fail to safeguard appropriate working conditions and specify tasks, in which the managing staff are unwilling to listen to the problems of their subordinates and delay the tackling thereof.
The said phenomena arise also in cases of rejecting or overlooking the existence of a conflict the result being that the conflict spreads, develops, and aggravates.
The Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs, and the Family recorded no complaint in 2008 regarding bullying, mobbing, or bossing at work.
Nor did it record a reported violation of the principle of equal treatment in occupational relations.
The data from 2008 regarding the control activities of the National Labour Inspectorate in Košice shows that there were two complaints filed by women claiming sexual harassment and 16 persons complained about bossing.
The Labour Inspectorate did not find out any breach of duty - discrimination by the employer.
To prove instances of bossing, mobbing, or bullying is not always possible.
Disputes may only be solved before the court.
After inspecting the suggestions and facts established by the employee those are entitled to evaluate their decision and turn to the court.
Most of them refuse this option.
Such cases are not reported to the Labour Inspectorate.
Those who report cases of discrimination usually decide to do so only if they think they have nothing more to lose, or while pointing out also other violations against their person.
They also mention their dissatisfaction with unequal treatment concerning them or a certain group of employees.
Considering the information above, the long term trend is that discrimination is not reported in general.
In the majority of reported cases discrimination cases were secondary.
It is therefore only when cases are inspected by labour inspectors and violation is determined on the side of the employers, for example in the field of gender equality.
stated that compared to the previous year the number of reported cases of alleged discrimination increased by 22 %.
The number of cases of actual discrimination, however, decreased by 62 %.
Based on the information obtained from the male and female clients of the Centre who objected violation of the principle of equal treatment in 2008 and complained about bullying at work we found out that the clients are afraid to object the violation of their right because they fear they might lose their jobs and accept the situation.
They decided to show activity and fight against bullying usually after they had been delivered a notification of the dismissal.
They objected that in their case the dismissal had nothing to do with organisational changes resulting from company restructuring, but was a result of inappropriate conflict solution at work, or personal revenge.
Sorrow, fear and inactivity of employees are an advantage for those employers who tolerate or advocate such behaviour.
In such cases, the Anti-Discrimination Act grants the right to a person assuming violation of their rights or interest or freedoms protected by the law by unequal treatment, and the possibility to claim their right before the court or out of court.
Today it is possible to use mediation, which is mentioned in another part of this Report.
In April 2008 the amended Anti-Discrimination Act came into effect that defined the term sexual harassment, whereby the Centre, by providing information and education activities, significantly contributed to elevating the awareness among the general public.
The problem here is not the legislation, but the nature of bullying and the role of the human factor in the prevention, revelation, and tackling thereof.
In Slovakia there is only a small number of judicial decisions concerning required protection from mobbing, which is a very small number compared to other occupational disputes.
In 2008 no judicial proceedings was finalised, in which the victim would claim mobbing or bullying - or a violation of he principle of equal treatment in occupational relations.
Amended Act on Employment Services and the Establishment of Social Enterprise
Since May 1st, 2008 the tools of active policy were enriched by the amended Act on Employment Services67.
The amendment created better employment conditions especially for the disadvantaged group of job seekers.
The majority of this group are individuals without training and qualification and poor or missing working habits who have been unemployed for at least two years.
In a social enterprise, at least 30 percent of employees for at least 12 calendar months are individuals who were considered disadvantaged job seeker.
Apart from that, a social company should create supportive working environment especially applying an individual approach in providing assistance to employees at their work.
A number of social enterprise pilot projects are carried out at this time around Slovakia.
Their efficiency and necessity may only be evaluated after a longer period of time.
Right to Housing
Despite the fact that the right to housing is not a constitutional right, the enforcement thereof was being dealt with in 2008 also by the Committee of the Council of the Government on Human Rights, Minorities and the Status of Women (Committee).
In the field of social policy the aim is to support community development, in field social work, and to create more local social services fostering inclusion, to evaluate the running programmes of community work and extend the programme of social workers working in municipalities to other localities.
In cooperation with the Association of Towns and Communities of Slovakia it is necessary to consider a legal regulation that would prevent the sale of residential buildings owned by municipalities to entrepreneurs in case there still are people living in them, whereby those have permanent stay in the municipality, in order to prevent their eviction or moving to other municipalities.
It is necessary to motivate municipalities to support the concept of a special recipient of social allowances in localities with high numbers of dodgers and to motivate municipalities to develop their own housing strategies.
One of the recommendations was that the Slovak Republic ratifies Article 30 (right to protection from poverty and social exclusion) and Article 31 (right to housing) Of the European Social Charter (the revised) and to the Collective Complaints Protocol.
The recommendations of the Committee of the National Council of the Slovak Republic were appreciated by international non-governmental organisations, the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) with headquarters in Geneva, as well as the European Roma Rights Centre (ERRC) with headquarters in Budapest.
The statement of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs, and Family of the Slovak Republic 69 indicates that in 2008 some work was done at the Ministry of Labour on the legal analysis of the (revised) European Social Charter of 1996.
Articles 30 and 31 were analysed as well.
Based on the conclusions a decision ought to be made on whether the Slovak Republic shall ratify the obligations
The proposal to accept the obligations resulting from the charter, more specifically the obligations extended by Articles 30 and 31, did not receive sufficient supported and was not adopted.
Eviction and Displacement of Indigent Citizens
In connection with evictions it is necessary to distinguish between forced eviction and lawful eviction.
Forced eviction concerns permanent or temporary removal of individuals and of their families from their homes against the will, which is arbitrary and unlawful.
According to the general interpretation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights “forced evictions are ... incompatible with the requirements of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and could only be justified in the most exceptional circumstances and in accordance with the relevant principles of international law ”.
On the other hand, the prohibition of forced evictions does not apply to evictions that are in compliance with the law and the provisions of the international covenants on human rights.
Eviction most often follows long-term failure to pay rent.
Towns and villages often leave the situation unsolved and the debt increases.
Only after the situation seems “sufficiently” unbearable (whereby this threshold may vary), the towns and villages opt for eviction.
Problems with dodgers are solved by moving dodgers from bigger flats to smaller ones, by displacing them to other localities, or by letting them land “on the street' ”.
Forced eviction should be the last resort only after all legal conditions have been met and appropriate form of legal and other protection provided to the persons affected.
They should try to avoid this type of last resort solution by applying a prophylactic approach through a properly defined social policy that would stop the debts from growing, decrease, or even annul them.
Most sites were located in the regions of Prešov and Košice: Veľké Kapušany, Strážske, Čierna nad Tisou, Sobrance, Spišský Štiavnik, Gelnica, Prešov, Lipany, Snina, Stará Ľubovňa, Sabinov, and Medzilaborce.
In the region of Žilina these included Liptovský Peter, Liptovská Porúbka, and Vavrišovo.
However, we may state that in many cases eviction was prevented (for example in Veľké Kapušany, Prešov, Lipany, or Čierna nad Tisou), because the self-governing region started effectively with the use of the concept of a special recipient of social allowances as a debt increase preventing tool.
In Strážske 36 persons - all of them dodgers - were evicted but negotiations between the Office of the Government's Plenipotentiary for Roma Communities and the town council resulted in the evicted families being provided with substitutive housing.
The Centre was monitoring the situation together with the engaged institutions.
It was proven once again that assigning families a special recipient to receive their social allowances and to use them for appropriate purposes is a very effective measure.
The town of Sobrance took over the management of the flats with predominantly Roma inhabitants from the nonfunctioning association of flat owners, since there was a threat of execution due to unpaid water bills,
The decreased number of evictions in 2008 was also due to an amended Civil Code by making the status of the tenant and the flat owner equal in cases of termination of the residential lease contract, the real usage of the concept of a trustee and the initiative of the national and international organisations dealing with the protection of human rights and civic associations.
Right to Education
In 2008 the system of education was reformed on the level of legislation.
Many
important executive ordinances were adopted as well.
New School Act and School Reform
On June 19th, 2008 the State Educational Programme was adopted, delimiting the general objectives of schools, the content framework of education and education standards for single school grades.
It is the basis for creating an individual school education system.
The late date of approval of the necessary materials caused that many teachers were elaborating education programmes without guidance notes and not even expert consultants were able to react to all problems arising.
245/2008 Act on Education and Upbringing (School Act) as amended.
326/2008 Regulation of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic on the types and paraphernalia of school certificates and other documents including the ways of the recording and keeping thereof .
325/2008 Regulation of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic on school facilities of education consultancy and prevention.
324/2008 Regulation of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic on primary Art Schools .
323/2008 Regulation of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic on special education facilities.
322/2008 Regulation of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic on specialised schools.
321/2008 Regulation of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic on language schools.
320/2008 Regulation of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic on primary schools.

306/2008 Regulation of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic on kindergartens
305/2008 Regulation of the Ministry of Education of the Slovak Republic on outdoor school
As regards the observance of the rights of minorities, there are problems with geographic names used in the textbooks published in the language of a national minority.
The problem was solved by an amendment, under which geographic names are to be given in the following way:
a) geographic names which are commonly used in the language of the minority shall be stated in both languages, first in the language of the minority and then in brackets or after a slash in the official language in a way used in study books issued and passed between 2002 and 2006,
b) cartographic works shall be named in the official language,
c) at the end of the study book a reference to all geographic names shall be made in form of a dictionary in the language of the minority and in the official language.
Although the pros and cons of the new school act are much discussed at present, the real benefits will only show in the future.
In October the Government adopted the National programme of Reforms in the Slovak Republic for the years 2008 - 2010.
Measures in the field of the development of the system of education are targeted at the informatisation of schools and the creation of study materials and tools.
An improvement of the quality of the system of education and upbringing is expected from the establishment of top secondary comprehensive schools which shall provide education at international level.
The school reform equalises the status of schools and school facilities regardless of the
The basic aim of the activities developed by this organisation is to perform certified measurements of the quality of education, and research and development in the field of measuring and evaluating the quality of education, continuous monitoring of the results of education, and of the status and development of education at the national level compared with the international level, and evaluating the quality of education on primary and secondary schools on the level of state education
programmes.
on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, Article 34 of the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights of the European Union and Article 12 of the European Social Charter and the Revised European Social Charter.
The right to benefit from social services is governed separately under Article 14 of the European Social Charter and the Revised Charter.
Paragraph 2 of Article 39 of the Constitution governs the right to such assistance, which is inevitable to safeguard basic living conditions - social assistance.
The tools to provide assistance are social services.
Under § 14 par. 1 of the said Act social services include specialised activities to tackle material need or social need of a citizen (caretaking service, communal boarding, transport service, services provided in assisted living centres, social loans).
The new Act on Social Services elaborated in cooperation with expert public and adopted on October 30th, 2008.76
Act on Social Services
Despite the fact that the Act on Social Services comes into effect only on January 1st, 2009 we presume that it is appropriate to inform briefly in this Report on the contents of the Act and on any comments made, in the course of the year 2008 to the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic by some non-governmental organisations, local self-government and other subjects.
The Act introduced new kinds of social services and professional activities, as well as social services targeted at selected groups of clients, community planning, improved quality and qualification in the provision of social services, and accreditation of education programmes.
Social services are divided into a number of groups based on the nature of the social situation and its severity or based on the target group of its recipients.
Social services are provided by means of professional activities that are to be provided by the service provider or safeguarded in case they are included in the service description.
The provider can carry out activities other than those governed under the Act, in case they increase the quality of the social service.
New social services are provided and a few kinds of new facilities.
For the purposes of providing a social service to an individual dependent on the assistance of another person the Act governs medical and social assessment activity, based on which the level of dependence of the individual on this social service is assessed.
A special part of the Act governs the financing of private service providers, that are legal entities or natural entities entered in the register of social service providers and fulfil the criteria set out by legal competences of the municipality and of the self-governing region in the provision of social services.
Surveillance over the compliance with this Act and other generally binding legal regulations in providing social services is made by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic.
Apart from that, the Ministry supervises the elaboration and application of social service development concepts elaborated by the self-governing regions, it also controls education programmes accredited by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic and decides on fines.
The self-governing regions also report that one of the biggest problems is the enforcement of § 8 par. 4 - which is the period for safeguarding a certain social service within 60 days.
On the other hand, the representatives of general public appreciated at the review session that was held on June 12th, 2008 open to the public for the period of 15 days, that among the basic principles of social services as defined by the draft Act there is also the prevention of an emerging unfavourable social situation, the tackling or moderation of an unfavourable social situation of an individual, a family or a community, and supported social inclusion, which relate directly to the named groups.
Retirement Homes, and Retirement Boarding Houses
In 2008, social services were provided under allocated fields of activities governed by law (§ 71 and 71 of the said Act) by municipalities and self-governing regions being self-governing authorities.
The admission of citizens into assisted living centres was done under the same rules and
regulations valid in 2007.
Due to the fact that the provision of social services is a segment after which there is more demand than offer throughout the whole territory of Slovakia, waiting lists are still used.
The result of what has been stated above is that in case there is a bed made free for the person on the waiting list, an agreement is made with that person on the provision of the social service under the new legal regulation.
It is therefore not decisive as regards the persons on the waiting list whether that person was assessed under the Act on Social Assistance or the Act on Social Services.
The positions on the waiting list are set according to the entry date and clients are provided the social service according to that list.
The waiting list is still valid and facilities are going to continue entering clients on those lists by passing a decision, in case the municipality of a self-governing region is unable to provide a social service in their facility or in a facility operated by another public or private provider.
In such case a
client is entered on the list and has to wait until there is a free bed in the centre they are interested in.
Right to Social Security
At international level, the right to social security is guaranteed under the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and the European Social Charter.
At national level, the Constitution of the Slovak Republic, especially Article 39 declares that all citizens have the right to adequate material provision in old age, in the event of work disability, as well as after losing their provider.
The main aim of this right is to create conditions for a dignified existence of all inhabitants living in the Slovak Republic.
Also in the curse of the year 2008 the Centre recorded a couple of complaints by the so called old-age pensioners regarding the amounts of their pensions and the discrepancies in the calculations of old age pensions based on various legal regulations.
The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family provided the following opinion on that issue :
The aim of the amended Act on Social Insurance that came into effect on August 1st, 2006 was to solve the most burning issues and ameliorate the differences between the “new” and the “old” retirement pensions at the transition from the security to the insurance system.
The recalculation concerned approximately 80 000 old age pensions granted from October 1st, 1988 to December 31st, 2003.
That concerned those old age pensions, during the calculation of which the average monthly salary over 10.000 SKK was not fully considered, or cases where the employment period after the granting of old age pension was not taken into consideration.
The amended Act on Social Insurance ought to offer a similar solution, the aim of which is to tackle the issue of old age pensions granted under the legal regulations effective before October 1st, 1988.
The amendment was adopted by Act No. 449/2008 Coll. The new legal regulation did not cause a blanket increase in pension amounts, but only considered circumstances which were previously not included in the calculation of the granted old age pensions.
A part of the amended Act on Social Insurance mentioned above was the deadline for increasing pension amounts,
79 Response of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic of March 18th, 2009, ref.:
From January 1st, 2009 all pensions are increased by 6.95 %.
The support of the state to families is provided predominantly in form of state social benefits.
These amounts are granted by the state to help citizens handle several life situations.
In case the person taking care of the child is not certified, the amount makes 39.67 € a month without the necessity to prove expenses.
The person is selected by the parents according to their needs.
According to the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, the benefit allows for the harmonisation of the working, occupational, and personal life of the parents and contributes to the improved employment rate among young parents and allows them to assert themselves on the job market.
This regulation was objected against by the Union of Mother Centres claiming that it posed a financial disadvantage in case of those parents who work or make business before the third birthday of their child, but choose a form of taking care of the child other than the institutionally provided or provided by a certified individual.

Rights of Patients
Single patient rights in healthcare provision are based on the right of a person to human dignity, self-determination, and autonomy.
The right to healthcare is defined as the right to take advantage of the advantages provided of the healthcare system and the system of healthcare services accessible in the state.
The rights of patients in the Slovak Republic are enshrined in a number of acts.
The selection of the most important rights of patients in the Slovak Republic is enshrined in the Charter of the Rights of Patients of the Slovak Republic.
The aim of the Charter is to make it easier for the patient to find their way around in the fundamental human rights and freedoms in the field of healthcare.
On March 23 , 2008 the Government of the Slovak Republic adopted the National Programme of Taking Care of Children and Youth in the Slovak Republic for the years 2008 - 2015.
The national programme includes a number of anti-discrimination tasks.
The contents of the tasks safeguard equality in the provision of healthcare in the Slovak Republic.
We asked the Health Care Supervision Authority and the Slovak Medical Chamber to provide us with an opinion on the enforcement of the rights of patients in the Slovak Republic in 2008.
In 2008 the Health Care Supervision Authority recorded the total of 1431 suggestions in the field of surveillance over healthcare provision.
Most complaints and suggestions submitted by citizens included dissatisfaction with the healthcare provision procedure in 1069 cases, out of which 340 related to death, 51 dealt with an unethical approach of a healthcare provider towards a patient and with work organisation in 54 cases.
Out of the total number of suggestions 761 were tackled and solved in connection with adequate provision of healthcare by December 31st, 2008.
Out of those 148 were substantiated and 613 unsubstantiated.
In 2008 the staff members of the Health Care Supervision Authority offered consultancy to insurance holders in connection with their rights in healthcare provision especially as regards the dissatisfaction with the healthcare services provided, the procedure of submitting the claim, of collecting fines (for office care, certificates), changes in health insurance, dissatisfaction with the attitude of healthcare providers, the ethics, information on the rights of patients in connection with
healthcare provision, health records (inspection of health records, making extracts and handing over of those records), information on the introduction of medical districts and referrals to specialists.
In 2008 the Slovak Medical Chamber recorded 1 licence suspension for 18 months based on a decision made by the court, 1 licence suspension for 12 months based on a decision made by the court and 1 licence suspension due to corruption.
The Slovak Medical Chamber recorded only one violation of the obligation of a member of the Slovak Medical Chamber to perform the occupation in a professional manner in compliance with generally binding legal regulations and the Code of Ethics.
b) clause 1 of the Act on Providers.
In connection with the rights of the patient the Centre stated that the data collected in the field in this area are scarce.
It would be advisable to deal with this issue in a more systematic manner.
The suggestions submitted with the Health Care Supervision Authority actually represent the only tangible data in this field.
Sterilisation of Roma Women
The case of unlawful sterilisations of Roma women continued also in 2008.
In the opinion of the advocate of the clients, not even the supplementary investigation performed failed to eliminate the lacks pointed out in the decision by the Constitutional Court.
By Resolution No. 1018 of October 29th, 2003 the Minister of Health was given a task to make accountable those hospital practitioners who violate the valid legal regulations and to perform an in-depth examination and analysis in healthcare providing facilities with the aim of verifying the alleged forced sterilisations and to identify discrimination practices against the Roma and examine the ways of obtaining informed consent from the patients.
Other tasks resulting from the resolution included the examination of the access of the marginalised groups to healthcare.
Hospitals in which administrative misconduct had been identified adopted remedy measures within the given deadline.
The Minister of Health removed from their position the head physician in the department of gynaecology and obstetrics at the hospital in Kežmarok after he was called to account.
While the issue was being tackled the Government of the Slovak Republic took a number of measures aimed at preventing the occurrence of such suspicions in the future.
The measures concerned predominantly the amendments in healthcare legislation (provisions concerning the non-discriminatory access to healthcare, a new legislation on the access to health records, the amended provisions of defining the conditions of voluntary and informed consent to sterilisation).
Unlawful sterilisation was enshrined in the new Criminal Code now as a new state of facts constituting a criminal act, reading that caesarean section and sterilisation must lie 30 days apart, within which informed consent must be obtained.
Immunomodulatory Therapy in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis over 45 Years of Age
The civic association of patients with multiple sclerosis Nádej (Hope) stated that: “This decision is right and patients suffering from multiple sclerosis over 45 years of age have been given hope to receive therapy with modern preparations and quicker access thereto.
National Programme of Sexual and Reproductive Health Protection
In March 2008 the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic submitted at the meeting of the government the draft “National Programme of Sexual and Reproductive Health”.
This happened after four years during which the legislative process of the said material was interrupted.
A week after the negotiation of the Government was interrupted at the point regarding the material in question (on March 26th, 2008), the reason being disagreement on the side of some ministers, a meeting of approximately 300 persons (representing predominantly Christian values) was organised to protest against the adoption of the submitted programme.
86 Draft National Programme of Sexual and Reproductive Health in the Slovak Republic was submitted for a supraministerial comment procedure at the beginning of March 2004, but not to the meeting of the Government.
health requires a complex and systematic approach.
Right to Environmental Protection
The right to the protection of the environment and to the information on the condition thereof was discussed in the Slovak society quite often also in the course of 2008.
The right to environment is considered the third generation of human rights by international
law regulations that is for now marked by a low level of protection and enforceability.
The dump is located near to blocks of flats and even near to the town centre.

91 On March 5th, 2008 the Slovak Inspectorate of the Environment issued a request aimed at the dump operator - the Westminster Brothers, prohibiting any dump creation works until the integrated permission comes into effect.
On May 21st, 2008 the Slovak Environment Inspection and the Environment Inspectorate in Bratislava requested the company Westminster Brothers, INC to immediately cease the dump creation works in Pezinok.
On June 18th, 2008 the Environment Inspectorate in Bratislava issued a decision requesting immediate cessation of the waste dump creation works in Pezinok.
On June 20th, 2008 the prosecutor of the general prosecutor's office of the Slovak Republic published an opinion indicating that the zoning decision issued by the Regional Building Authority in Bratislava on the creation of the waste dump in Pezinok is lawful.
On August 18th, 2008 the Slovak Environment Inspection decided that the objections of Pezinok activists and of the mayor of the town against the issuance of the integrated permit to create a waste dump are unsubstantiated.
The operator of the waste dump in Pezinok - the American company Westminster Brothers obtained all the permits necessary to create the waste dump.
The Ministry had the competences to revoke the decision that allowed for the waste dump to be created, whereby there was no deadline for issuing the statement.
Considering the obstructions,
On December 4th, 2008 the Regional Court in Bratislava rejected the action filed by the civic activists and the town of Pezinok against the decision issued by the Slovak Environment Inspection allowing the creation of the dump in the town.
On January 22nd, 2009 the Ministry of the Environment of the Slovak Republic finalised the non-appealable proceedings, the aim of which was to determine the lawfulness of the dump creation and decided that the waste dump in Pezinok was being created lawfully.
The Ministry stated that no inaccurateness was found in the decision making process of the Slovak Environment Inspection.
state until a decision on the lawfulness of the permit is passed.
Citizen health protection and environment protection could be presented by the operator after closing of the dump by its recultivation, which was not the case.
Considering the fact that at present sharp practice is used in connection with similar waste dumps the Centre points out the necessity to adjust the competences of self-governing regions so that they can decide on hazardous waste dumps and big dumps to be created within the territories registered in their land registry.

4. RIGHTS OF NATIONAL AND OTHER MINORITIES
While assessing the observance of human rights in the year 2008 we shall deal with the assessment of facts in the field of human rights of members of minorities in this chapter.
Just as last year, we shall concentrate on minorities from the point of view of their nationality and ethnicity and on individuals with disabilities, who also are a minority due to their status within the society.
As regards the observance of rights of homosexuals who also are a minority in this sense, we deal with that in the first chapter in connection with the right to privacy and in a separate part in connection with the right to equal treatment.
The Rights of National Minorities and Ethnic Groups
In our assessing the enforceability of the rights of national minorities and ethnic groups we must highlight that in compliance with the obligation to observe natural human rights and human dignity that the dominating majority must not deepen their being disadvantaged (discriminated).
People who are a minority need special rights enshrined in international documents which the dominating majority does not.
Due to this the Council of Europe being an international regional organisation adopted the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages at the beginning of the nineties.
Because the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities has been in effect for more than 10 years, we deal with it in a separate chapter.
The status of national minorities in the Slovak Republic was influenced by the adoption of a number of Acts in 2008.
That was for example the new School Act, the Act on Name and Surname or the Act on Organising Sports Events.
In June 2008 the Government was dealing with the Second Report on the Implementation of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, as well as with the recommendations addressed to the Slovak Republic by the Ministerial Committee of the Council of Europe.
In the report, the Government informed of the adopted legal regulations and the changes thereof relating to national minorities and on the prepared concepts and acts relating to selected provisions of the Charter.
In connection with the development in the field of majority-minority relations significantly influenced by the sharpened political discussion, the members of some minorities living in Slovakia
perceive the issues relating to human rights in general and the rights of minorities in a more sensitive way.
This also is the result of a research that the Centre carried out in the second half of 2008.95
These were most important for one fifth of the respondents of Hungarian minority, but only for around 13 % of the Slovak population.
The results of the research show that members of the Hungarian minority perceive the human rights and national minority issues in a more sensitive way, and the present situation in the area of human rights in a more negative way and show concerns regarding the observance thereof.
As stated in the final report to the research96, the issue of human rights observance from the point of view of the Hungarian minority certainly deserves more attention in the light of those results.
In connection with national minority rights it is necessary to state that the members of the Ruthenian minority have for a long time felt that their minority rights were not observed properly.
According to the responses provided by the representative of the Rusin Revival society Rusínska obroda in the Slovak Republic, as well as by the ““pro-Ukrainian” organisation of Ruthenians and Ukrainians, these two national minorities are usually considered as merged into one, however, the Ruthenian national minority is an independent minority, and nothing like a Ruthenian-Ukrainian nationality exists in the Slovak Republic.
The response indicated that the members of the Ruthenian minority meet with insufficient acceptance of their being an independent national minority, which very much influences the field of minority culture.
The Tenth Anniversary of the Framework Convention of the Council of Europe for the Protection of National Minorities
The Slovak Republic became party to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 1998.
The Framework Convention was elaborated by the Council of Europe as the first generally binding multilateral document dealing with the protection of national minorities and the rights that belong to the national minorities.
96 Ibidem, p. 45.
97 Letter from the society Rusínska obroda of March 18th, 2009.
The committee also appreciated the establishment of an institution to monitor and accept discrimination complaints - the Ombudsman - as well as the increase in finances provided to the development of culture of national minorities.
The committee further appreciated positive changes in the field of education, more specifically the establishment of the university in Komárno.
However, the Committee also pointed out some lacks in legislation dealing with national minorities.
As regards the Roma minority, there are serious problems in the field of employment, housing, and healthcare.
The committee pointed out social exclusion, misconduct on the side of the police, existing racially motivated crime, as well as the segregation of Roma children.
Several recommendations have been adopted by the Committee to further improve the implementation of the Convention.
The Government of the Slovak Republic informed in their evaluation report, that a detailed findings of the advisory committee and the evaluation of the fulfilment of the Framework Convention and the provisions thereof included in the evaluation report shall be subjected to examination, assessment and standpoints shall be adopted and suggestions and recommendations should be applied by the competent state authorities, or other stakeholders in the course of the next monitoring period.
In other points the Government assessed the findings of the advisory committee and provided the reactions to their statements.
They especially appreciated the approach of the advisory committee consisting of concentrating on the evaluation of the status of the Roma minority.
At the same time they noted that the problems concerning the Roma minority are of a complex (and not only of minority nature) affecting the whole society.
At present, the third round of monitoring as well as the third implementation report to the Framework Convention is being prepared under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
By Decision No. 1983/2006/ES of December 18th, 2006 the European Parliament and the Council of Europe proclaimed the year 2008 the “European year of intercultural dialogue Among the main aims
The areas are as follows: culture and the media, education and science, migration, minorities, multilingual communication, religion, workplaces and the youth.
Conferences were organised
dealing with the contributions and advantages of a multicultural environment.
The National Education Centre in cooperation with the Economic University organised an international conference dealing with intercultural dialogue “Intercultural dialogue - a tool of stability and development within the European area”.
In order to support projects aimed at the development of intercultural dialogue room has been created within the grant programmes Culture of the Disadvantaged Groups of Society and Culture of National Minorities.
Protection and Development of the Culture of National Minorities and Ethnic Groups
In Slovakia, there are four nationality theatres (two Hungarian, one Ruthenian and on Roma theatre).
At present, the theatres are administered by higher territorial units.
The Slovak National Museum operates eight museums representing minority cultures.
The programme is aimed at supporting equal opportunities, preventing discrimination, and supporting intercultural dialogue.
101 Article 2 Of the Decision No 1983/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008).
According to the statement of the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry makes effort to make the grant programmes more effective with the aim of safeguarding objective, transparent, fair and stable financial system of supporting the culture of minorities.
104 In 2008 the procedures of electronic registration and made the system of electronic registration and accelerated the internal process of approving single applications for financial support.
12 minority committees work within the National Minorities Programmes.
The committee decides on the amount of financial contribution to single projects and acts as an advisory body for the Minister.
The financial resources to support minority cultures increased in amount in 2008, however, the representatives of the Hungarian minority criticised the fact that the share in financial resources allocated for the support of their culture decreased by 10 %.
The Centre addressed the members of the Council of the Government for National minorities in connection with the evaluation of the development and support of minority culture in the Slovak Republic.
The addressed representatives were to assess whether the culture of the minorities is sufficiently supported and to identify the positive and negative aspects of the support granted by state administration and self-government authorities, and assess whether there are differences on different levels (regional, national).
Furthermore, they were to assess what needs to be changed in granting support to the development of culture of national minorities on local, regional, and national level.
The responses of the Bulgarian and Croatian Cultural Association indicate that they appreciate the support granted to the development of their national minority.
Both associations meet with support on both the regional and national level.
The Croatian association expressed dissatisfaction with the support granted by the town and the regional culture administration office.
The representatives of the Croatian Culture Association also miss an informal dialogue and exchange of experience dealing with the development of culture of national minorities.
The result of what has been mentioned above is that the support granted to the development of culture of national minorities by the Ministry of Culture within the detailed grant system is sufficient, however, by adopting the act on the financing thereof the area would be made more transparent and
Medium-term Concept of Roma Minority Development
In March 2008 the Government of the Slovak Republic adopted the Medium-term Concept of Roma Minority Development titled: Solidarity, integrity, inclusion.
The said material was criticised already at the review session.
Many remarks were presented by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic, as well as by some nongovernmental organisations.
Considering the importance of the strategic concept document, eighteen non-governmental organisations and four natural persons working in Roma communities on Roma integration submitted to the vice prime minister of the Slovak Republic and the Government Plenipotentiary of the Slovak Republic for Roma communities a statement to the draft medium-term concept in January 2008.
The objections concerned the contents and formal issues.
In their opinion, the measures contained therein were unclear, risky, and controversial.
Even the final form of the adopted material was criticised by the third sector.
The resolution only includes the role of the ministers to participate in the elaboration of programmes that are in the competence of the ministries.
Considering the fact that the concept has been in effect for around a year, the Centre addressed the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Roma Communities (Office of the Plenipotentiary) and applied for a continuous monitoring thereof.
The questions asked concerned the activities contained in the concept in single areas and the ways in which they were performed.
Because the concept did not contain directly the prohibition of discrimination and the observance of human rights, our questions were also directed at into what extent those principles were taken into consideration in the concept.
We were also interested in whether the concept was dealing with the adoption of temporary positive action measures, considering the absence of any ethnic data collection.
According to the statement of the Office of the Plenipotentiary,105 the principle of observing human rights and the prohibition of discrimination is not explicitly enshrined in the concept, however, the adherence to those principles must result directly from the creation of a more advantageous environment for the marginalised Roma communities in the monitored areas such as housing, education, employment and social inclusion, and healthcare.
The temporary positive action measures were also reflected in the main objective of the concept.
As the response indicated, this ought to help create a conceptual model of forming a more advantageous environment for the marginalised groups to provide for their sustainable social development and the development of community and social services and integration aimed ad social change.
The Office of the Plenipotentiary also described their activities, measures, and steps taken in single areas at which the concept is directed.
The area of education and upbringing of Roma children and youth is considered a priority by the Office of the Plenipotentiary.
This is proven by the activities carried out so far, which help improve the current situation in the education and upbringing of Roma pupils.
The Office participates in various projects and programmes of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture and other Slovak ministries.
At the end of June 2008 the Roma language was standardised under the auspices of the Office of the Plenipotentiary, which laid the foundations for education and upbringing in the Roma language.
An advisory committee for education was established, which is the advisory and initiating authority to tackle issues of increasing the level of education and vocational training of Roma citizens.
In April 2008 a European conference was organised, titled “Education and upbringing of Roma children and youth”.
The Office of the Plenipotentiary participated actively in the programme of supporting the health of disadvantaged communities in Slovakia for the years 2007-2015 carried out by the Minister of Health in cooperation with the Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic.
In 2008 there were 10 in-field medical coordinators and 20 in-field medical assistants working within 12 regional public health authority offices in Slovakia, which is insufficient in the opinion of the Office of the Plenipotentiary.
The activities of the Office of the Plenipotentiary in the social field were directed at interrelating and using the programmes and social services in place aimed at the work in the marginalised Roma communities with other activities and aims in single municipalities, for example the system if in-field social work.
Based on what has been stated above the elaboration of a strategic document - such as the concept of solving the issues of the marginalised Roma communities, may be assessed in a positive manner.
The quality and efficiency of this material and the criticism will only be evaluated in the future.
Rights of Persons with Disabilities
The quality of life of persons with disabilities is very much influenced by the level of their self-sufficiency, but also by the way they are treated by the society.
This means that from the point of view of a social model of a disability described in the previous report it is also necessary to examine, what attitude the society adopts towards the role of abolishing barriers and fulfil the specific needs of the disabled.
Present day documents on international and national level relating to the disabled include calls and obligations to respect their needs and help create appropriate conditions to achieve their full inclusion addressed to relevant subjects or the whole society.
They also include support of active participation of people with disabilities in everyday life and in the processes of making decisions that immediately affect them.
The basis of successful integration of people with disabilities is provided if the rest of the society sees those people equal.
One of the requirements was the application for financial assistance and support provided to organisations associating the disabled.
The result of the protests was the meeting with the Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Family and the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic.
During the negotiations the system of subsidies was explained by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic that help the organisations operate.
The Ministry expressed support to the tax bonus in relation to children of disabled parents and opened other topics in connection with the situation the disabled at present.
The calls and comments on the side of the organisers of the second protest gathering dealt with the draft acts on social services and the act on financial compensation benefits, which at that time were submitted for a review session.
The Prime Minister promised to discuss with the Minister of Health the negative impact of drug categorisation on the situation of the disabled and required that a report be elaborated on the situation of the disabled living in Slovakia, and asked for help in tackling the subsistence of the National Council of Persons with Disabilities of the Slovak Republic.
The report on the campaign, which started by the gathering, indicates that the representatives of the National Council of Persons with Disabilities of the Slovak Republic consider the protest gathering substantiated and successful.
During the second half of the year 2008 there was a transformation of the Council of the Government for Citizens with Disabilities to the Council of the Government for Persons with Disabilities (the Council).
The Council operates as an advisory body of the Government on the level of the Vice Prime Minister.
The members of the Council count a lot of representatives who are disabled.
Republic represented by the President signed the Convention and Optional Protocol in September 2007, it has never been ratified.
We informed in the previous report that the government required in the resolution that responsible ministers and the Vice Prime Minister perform an analysis of the compliance of the legal regulations valid in the Slovak Republic with the obligations resulting from the Convention.
For the purposes of this years report we had gathered information on the course of implementation of the Convention and on the preparation of the ratification thereof.
In the group function the representatives of relevant ministries, the selfgovernment and the representative of Slovakia in the working group “High Level Committee for Disability Issues”.
Based on the requirement of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family single government departments elaborated a series of analyses to assess the harmony of Slovak legislation, which was submitted to the members of the working group.
The analyses state that there are no serious impediments to the ratification of the Convention.
The National Council of Persons with Disabilities played an active role in 2008 in the process of preparing the ratification and the implementation of the Convention.
They organised a conference on the premises of the National Council of the Slovak Republic dealing with the Convention and further application thereof in practice.
What was considered a contribution of the conference was the extended knowledge of the process of ratification in other countries, as well as on the ways of supporting and financing organisations of persons with disabilities.
The conference contributed to improved awareness among the representatives of the organisation of persons with disabilities and the members of parliament.
The Centre addressed the National Council of Persons with Disabilities and the Ministry of Labour with questions regarding possible lack of compliance with the rules and the provisions thereof in relation to the disability issue.
Because the examples of compliance or lack of compliance of our legal regulations with the Convention the newly adopted acts on social services and financial benefits to compensate for severe disability were used, we shall deal with this topic in Chapter 4.2.3.
Evaluation of the National Programme to Develop Living Conditions of Persons with
Disabilities in all Areas of Life
In 2008 measures defined in 2006 and 2007 were evaluated within the assessment of the National Programme to Develop Living Conditions of Persons with Disabilities in all Areas of Life.
As has been stated by the National Council of Persons with Disabilities these measures were evaluated under the conditions that the National Programme shall be elaborated anew by the newly constituted Council of the Government for Persons with Disabilities.
The representatives of persons with disabilities recommended that the measures for the next period be elaborated according to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.
This way, the process of evaluating the fulfilment of provisions of single articles of the Convention shall be simplified.
“106 One of the measures fulfilled was the measure relating to the amended act on free access to information.
According to the report of the secretariat of the Council of the Government the fulfilment of measures to increase the awareness of general public is considered insufficient.
Even if adjustments were made in this field, the evaluation does not provide a clear opinion on their implementation.
The two tasks that were assessed as unfulfilled in the report were the tasks in the field of healthcare focusing on prophylactic measures to prevent disability and genetic counselling.
The same is indicated regarding the provision of services of work and social rehabilitation, where the disabled required that specific adjustments be made in legislation.
The tasks set out in the field of support services that were meant to help increase the level of independence and implementation of rights of persons with disabilities were not met, although they were well elaborated.
Another area of providing support services are the travel ticket discounts.
Although discounts are provided, the process is not simple.
The passing of the Act on Pricing in this area is a long-term process, and due to that the measure resulting from the Concept of Car, Bus and Rail Transport to finance the ticket discounts was not met.
The most extensive area in the process of creating equal opportunities in the report was the area of accessibility.
Measures were supposed to map the barriers in education facilities, public buildings, and public transport, etc. The report stated that some institutions monitored the presence of barriers and removed them gradually.
Barriers are removed very slowly also in the field of culture.
Another measure that was pronounced unfulfilled was the measure of assigning such research topics, the results of which could be used in adopting conceptual and legislative measures in the social area.
According to the report the measures resulting from the National Programme were not elaborated on the regional and local level, and were thus not accessible to the citizens.
The report also gives examples of measures that ought to be implemented in order to apply the National Programme in practice in the most effective manner.
This task is being fulfilled only partially.
The National Council of Persons with Disabilities stated that the fulfilment of measures was uneven, which is caused by the fact that the tasks are split or overlapping, and by multiple programme amendments; and it was therefore decided that a new programme shall be elaborated, which is the effort of the National Council of Persons with Disabilities and the representatives of persons with disabilities in cooperation with the Council of the Government for Persons with Disabilities.
The adoption of the said acts had been long awaited by the disabled and the organisations associating them.
The Centre was therefore interested whether these organisations had a possibility to participate in the elaboration of both acts and make reservations.
We also wanted to know into what extent their reservations were taken into consideration and account.
The aim of the Ministry was to achieve consensus in the preparation of draft acts.
The remarks made by the National Council of Persons with Disabilities, also those of substantial nature, were accepted only partially, and some were not accepted at all.
This has been confirmed also by the Ministry of Labour.
The reasons of the failure to accept the remarks or their partial acceptance included the present economic possibilities of the state, and lack of financial resources that may be allocated for compensations from the state budget.
By not accepting the remarks made by organisations representing persons with disabilities, it was not possible, in their opinion, to abolish all discriminative elements in the newly adopted acts.
A limit set this way is considered a system drawback and directly discriminatory on the grounds of age.
What was assessed as positive by organisations representing persons with disabilities was the introduction of a valorisation mechanism in relation with repeated financial contributions.
The Ministry of Labour as well as the National Council of Persons with Disabilities have confirmed that both acts have been in effect for too short a period of time, and it was therefore not possible to assess the effects and application thereof in practice.
The Ministry of Labour is preparing to monitor how these acts are applied in practice these months and based on that to suggest and prepare measures and changes of legislative and non-legislative nature.
The Centre pointed out in 2007 already, that the removal of various types of barriers in relation to persons with disabilities is too lengthy and slow.
In 2008 the Slovak Blind and Partially Sighted Union was monitoring websites created in the public and private sectors.
It monitored their compliance with the Act on Information Systems of Public Administration and pointed out to many problems and lacks in practice.
As regards social insurance houses, we received responses from four out of 7 insurance companies we addressed.
I these cases there are no barriers at the entrances to all institutions: Nové Zámky, Zvolen, Rimavská Sobota and Humenné.
A completely barrier free object is located only in the town of Humenné.
The reasons for not providing a completely barrier free access to usually include lack of financial resources, and also the fact that the offices are located on rented premises.
The institutions did not adopt a standpoint regarding other types of barriers.
As regards district police corps directorates, we received replies from all addressed institutions.
The replies make it clear that barrier free access is safeguarded only in the towns of Čadca and Zvolen.
In the tow of Rimavská Sobota there is barrier free access to the building of the district police corps department.
In the towns of Nové Zámky, Poprad, Humenné and Dolný Kubín there is no barrier access to the building.
In Námestovo and Nižná there is barrier free access to the department where they issue documents.
There also are lifts in the building of the district police corps department in Čadca.
In Zvolen there is a device installed at entrance to help people with impaired hearing.
Other institutions did not provide an explanation regarding other barriers.
The addressed institutions stated that the issue of barrier free access is to be handled by regional police corps directorates.
As regards municipal authorities, the following offices do have barrier free access: Nové Zámky, Rimavská Sobota, Humenné and Zvolen.
The town of Nové Zámky also has a lift.
The other replies did not include an answer regarding the condition of barriers in the buildings.
In case the buildings are not completely barrier free, they usually have a client centre or an information point on the ground floor.
The institutions did not explain the condition of other barriers.
Many towns already have adopted new investment plans to remove architectonic barriers.
They create websites which fulfil the needs of persons with disabilities.
What is considered the greatest problem in removing barriers is the lack of financial resources.
Out of all offices of labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic we addressed only one did not respond.
The in-field office in Kysucké Nové Mesto does not have a barrier free access.
Completely barrier free access is safeguarded to the offices of labour, Social Affairs and Family in Humenné, Kežmarok, and Žilina.
The institution in Rimavská Sobota also has a lift, but there are barriers at the entrances to single offices.
There is a
sound signal for the visually impaired on the premises in Rimavská Sobota, Kežmarok, Humenné, Žilina, and Nové Zámky.
In some cases the said institutions state that the parking places there are special parking spots for the disabled.
The addressed institutions stated that persons with impaired hearing usually come to the office in the company of another person.
In case that is not the case, they use gesticulation or lip-reading when communicating with the employees of the office.
The employees of the office of labour, Social Affairs and Family in Nové Zámky attended a course in sign language to improve communication with persons with impaired hearing.
Based on the findings we must state that in most cases the addressed institutions see the issue of having barriers only in relation to persons with disabilities.
The conditions of providing access to persons with disabilities to information and services vary in state institutions and public.
In some cases these institutions are located in old buildings that do not meet the criteria of barrier free access.
Despite what has been mentioned above, the addressed institutions have not recorded complaints in connection with the existence of barriers.
The Accessibility of the New Euro Currency to the Visually Impaired in Slovakia
108 The blind: Using tools to get ready for Euro.
Article by the Slovak News Agency, 21. 9. 2008.
The said regulation not only relates to persons with disabilities, but also to the elderly, who have problems walking over longer distances.
In case it is not possible due to security reasons to transport a disabled person, it is necessary to introduce the obligation to reimburse or rebook the flight ticket.
Information on airports should be available in an appropriate format to persons with disabilities.
All airports ought to undergo a quality audit.
It is also important to increase awareness among the train the airport staff in dealing with the disabled.
In case disabled aids are lost or damaged, the aviation company should compensate for the loss or damage in full amount.
Furthermore, there is the possibility to let assistance dogs on board without restrictions and engage citizens in the process of implementing the Regulation.
Since coming into effect, the Regulation is valid in full extent for every EU member state.
In some articles it refers to national regulations, for example as regards the compensations for loss or damage of a disabled aid.
The role of national councils of persons with disabilities is to cooperate with airports in applying the contents of the Regulation.
They should for example participate in determining a spot at the airport, on which the disabled person is supposed to inform the staff of their arrival, and help fulfil quality standards of providing assistance, and monitor the process of implementation.
The main role of organisations associating persons with disabilities is to educate airport staff in these issues.
Every member state is obliged to appoint an authority responsible for the adherence to the regulation, provision of information on the rights resulting thereof, and on the ways of submitting complaints of the violation thereof.
111 See the report on the implementation of the anti-discrimination legislation in the transportation rules of the transport companies.
5. RIGHTS CONNECTED WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS
The real life application of human rights protection is possible only based on some rights that have a constant place in the system of fundamental human rights.
This predominantly concerns the right to protection by the court that guarantees to everybody the right to claim protection of their rights before the court or another authority.
At international level, this right is governed under Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as well as Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
At national level the right to protection by the court and other legal protection is guaranteed under Articles 46 to 50 of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic.
The term “other legal protection” under the settled case law of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic means protection provided by the prosecutor's office, administration authorities, or by advocates.
It is usually the courts that decide on the protection of human rights in the Slovak Republic.
- introduce the institute of petty legal disputes with a simplified procedural action,
- introduce electronic communication between the court and the parties to the proceedings,
- provide maximum protection by means of temporary injunction in most complicated cases with a threat of irreparable harm,
115 Act No. 99/1963 Coll., Civil Procedure Code as amended.
connection with violation of the principle of equal treatment and in cases concerning consumer protection, for whose protection legal entities are established, most of them being associations.
The Code of Civil Procedure amended by Act No. 484/2008 Coll. was a reaction to the so called “TIPOS case " and enabled the general prosecutor - especially due to lack of time - to submit a review in burning cases also without justification.
At the same time, the submission of extraordinary review itself results in automatic delay in the enforceability of the contested decision.
Its aim was to provide for the basic legal preconditions for a problem free and successful introduction of the Euro currency and the inclusion of the Slovak Republic into the Eurozone, an organised and fluent handling of all issues of key importance in connection with the Euro changeover from the Slovak crown in the field of civil law.
The last changes in the Code of Civil Procedure in 2008 concerned the new amendment regarding the possibility to order the person using or threatening violence out of the flat in cases of domestic violence.
It introduced the shortening of the period from 7 days to 48 hours in case the court decides on the proposal to issue a temporary injunction by which the court orders the person using or threatening violence not to enter the flat or house in which the person towards whom the person allegedly used or threatened violence lives.
Act No. 71/1992 Coll. on Court Fees as amended was changed twice in 2008, especially with the Euro changeover in Slovakia.
With effect from January 1st, 2009 the amounts of court fees were set out for proceedings concerning cases of breach to the principle of equal treatment.
118 Court fees (annex to Act No. 71/1992 Coll.), item 7d:
a) motion to commence proceedings in cases related to the violation of the principle of equal treatment under special act - without the proposal to pay compensation for other than proprietary loss in cash - amounting to 66 Euros,
b) motion to commence proceedings in cases related to the violation of the principle of equal treatment under special act - with paid compensation for other than proprietary loss - amounting to 66 Euros and 3 % of the amount of the claimed other than proprietary loss.
These amendments are considered very positive by the Centre.
At the same time the Centre points out the necessity to start a discussion regarding the covering of legal charges in cases related to the violation of the principle of equal treatment.
Right to Effective Remedy
Article 13 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms enshrines the right to an effective legal remedy.
Failure to Respect the Decision of the European Court for Human Rights in the Case of
the Journalist M. Klein
The European Court of Human Rights (European Court) decided on October 31st, 2006 that the Slovak Republic violated the freedom of speech by sentencing the journalist M. Klein for the crime of defamation of nation, race, and belief by the court in Košice.
However, the subsequent development of the case was complicated by the decision issued by the Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic of June 14th, 2007, which did not respect the judgement of the European Court and confirmed the verdict of the court of Košice.
The priority position of the Convention is respected and recognised also by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic.
It is necessary to state that in the Klein case there was no legislative problem resulting from the decision made by the European Court.
The final solution to the case was issued by the decision of the District Court of Košice I. of September 19th, 2008, which freed the journalist Martin Klein.
The said decision put an end to the case after nearly eight years.
None of the parties to the dispute appealed again the decision.
According to the information we had at our disposal Mr. Klein was also paid a compensation of immaterial loss.
Right to Independent and Impartial Trial
It may be distinguished in this context between a subjective approach, which is the effort to persuade the judge in a given case, and objective approach, which is to determine whether the granted guarantees are sufficient to exclude any doubt to that effect.
Nearly out of those concerned the right to a hearing of the case within a reasonable time and only a small ratio of them concerned the right to just judicial proceedings specifically.
Right to a Trial within Reasonable Time
The said guarantee further underlines the importance of administration of justice without delay, which
might jeopardise the effects and credibility thereof.
In 2008 the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic was dealing with delays in proceedings objected in 689 constitutional complaints.
Out of those, the Constitutional Court stated violation of the fundamental right to a hearing without unreasonable delay (according to the Constitution), or the right to a hearing within a reasonable time (according to the Convention) in 292 cases in 2008.
In 2008 the Ombudsman established unreasonable delay in judicial proceedings in 104 cases, whereby they point out every year, that the courts in the Slovak Republic still deal with the proceedings started at the beginning of the nineties of the last century.
In 2008 established that there was a delay of 30 years in the judicial proceedings and some other judicial proceedings that took 17
In 12 cases the European Court, by passing the decision, recognised the reconciliation between the claimants and the Government and decided that the complaints be removed from the list of cases.
All those cases concerned the right to a fair trial (one of them also concerned other rights).
In 1 case concerning the right to fair trial the European Court decided in favour of the Slovak Republic by deciding that the complaint was substantiated after the Government and the complainant presented an opinion on the complaint.
In another 3 cases concerning the right to fair trial the European Court announced the decisions by which it announced one part of the complaint clearly unsubstantiated and therefore inacceptable, or due to failure to use the internal remedy.
of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic Announced by the Constitutional Court of the
Slovak Republic
Bratislava : Kancelária VOP, 2009, p. 13 - 19.
In 2008 the Constitutional Court dealt with the objected violation of Article 46 of the Constitution in 791 cases.
Out of the given number violation of Article 46 of the Constitution was established in 80 cases.
126 A number of cases concerned insufficiently substantiated decisions.
At the same time, it also must keep in mind its general persuasiveness.
In other words, it must keep in mind that the premises selected in the decision, as well as the conclusions made based on those premises are acceptable, rational, and last but not least just and persuasive for lawyers and lay public.
A determination of law in the case by the general court may be criticised by the Constitutional Court only in case the conclusions that were used by the general court in passing the decision were unsubstantiated or arbitrary (mutatis mutandis I.
Right to Compensation of Damage Caused by Decision of a Court or a Public
In the course of the year 2008 there were two amendments to Act No. 514/2003 Coll. on n liability for damage caused during the exercise of public authority as amended.
The Centre has not received answers to those questions.
This conclusion results from the fact that a judicial distrainer is a person appointed and authorised by the state to perform a forced execution of judicial decisions and other decisions.
Their activity depends on whether the court issues an authorisation to perform the distraint, and they are obliged by the decisions passed by the executionary court in full extent.
The result of that is that a court executor is not allowed to start with the distraint activity without the decision of the executionary court, whereby
it is the executionary court that bears legal responsibility resulting from the issuance of the authorisation until the distraint is completed in a way allowed or ordered by law.
Another conformation of the fact that distraint protection is part of judicial protection results from the system of legal remedies in execution according to the Code of Distraint Procedure.
Human Rights and Distraint
In connection with distraint a couple of cases was disclosed to the public in 2008 - these were suspected unlawful distraint procedures of executors violating human rights.
The same month the Minister of Justice required that a distrainer from the region of Žilina be removed from office, who executed the enforcement of the claim amounting to 256.172 SKK with accessions allegedly grossly violated their obligations resulting from the Code of Distraint Procedure.
132 See: Slovak Press Agency (SITA) of January 11th, 2008.
The state has a crucial responsibility for the observation and protection of human rights and freedoms not only by creating legislation and appropriate mechanisms and adopting human rights protection development concepts, but also by promoting their due application in practice.
The institutional framework of legal assistance provision in the field of protection and promotion of human rights is set by a number of subjects.
The issue of human rights, national minorities and ethnic groups is being dealt with on governmental level at the section for human rights and minorities at the Office of the Government of the Slovak Republic, which also deals with the suggestions of persons objecting violation of fundamental rights and freedoms.
135 See: Webnoviny, Aktuality.sk of October 12th, 2008.
not in compliance with the legal order.
were outside the scope of their competences.
The report contains measures to redress the established violations, describes the activities that the Ombudsman performed in the framework of the competences outlined by law, specifies procedures within their own initiative in legislative activities, in providing legal guidance, and in the field of improving legal awareness and international cooperation.
The information provided by the Office of the Ombudsman to the Centre upon request indicates that in 2008 the Ombudsman did not prove violation of Article 12 of the Constitution.
They did not provide legal assistance to discrimination victims under the law, beyond the framework of their competences, but provided legal guidance of their own initiative, consisting of an explanation of the legal regulation related to their problem and the possible solutions thereto, or information on the activities of the organisations that might help solve the problem.
Another important institution focusing on the protection of human rights and the observance of the equal treatment is the Slovak National Centre for Human Rights, which has been operating in the field for 15 years in Slovakia as one of the oldest institutions for the protection of human years.
138 More information is available at www.vop.gov.sk.
Since 2004, it has also been providing assistance to the victims of discrimination and intolerance manifestations.
Since 2007, it has been operating also via their 7 regional offices in Dolný Kubín, Humenné, Kysucké Nové Mesto, Kežmarok, Rimavská Sobota, Nové Zámky and Zvolen.
More detailed information on the activities of the Centre in 2008 is provided in a separate pert of the Report.
The Centre for Legal Assistance being a state budgetary organisation provides legal assistance through their employees and advocates.
In case the applicant fulfils the criteria of being provided with legal assistance, the Centre provides them with complex legal assistance in forms ranging from legal consultancy to representation before the court by a lawyer of the Centre or an advocate.
There are resident offices of the Centre in the towns of Bratislava, Banská Bystrica, Košice, Žilina, Prešov, Humenné and Hlohovec.
In 2008 an office was opened in Liptovský Mikuláš and Tvrdošín.
Further assistance is provided in the scope of the competences of the Centre by their consultancy offices in Levoča, Svidník, and Snina.
In 2008 a consultancy office was established in Čadca and Sobrance.
From the point of view of the scope of activities and competences of these specialised institutions and their representation offices in the regions it is possible to state that they provide important blanket protection of the rights in the Slovak Republic in an appropriate extent.
An irreplaceable role in the provision of legal assistance in connection with the protection of human rights is played by non-governmental organisations, which, apart from providing assistance to the persons affected, often initiate and prepare changes in legislation.
In case mediation results in agreement prior to the commencement of the proceedings or in the course thereof or in the course of arbitration proceedings, the parties to the proceedings are paid back a set percentage of the court fee.
At present, there are 282 mediators entered in the list of mediators kept at the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic.
There are 12 on the list of mediation centres and 6 on the list of mediation education institutions.
Because the Act has been in effect for more than 4 years, it is necessary to deal with the issue of whether the mediation institute fulfilled the expectations.
After three years of the Act's
implementation the mediation practice was evaluated based on an opinion poll among the mediators with the aim of examining how the existence of the Act translated into the provision and usage of mediation services.
The results of the examination pointed out that in Slovakia the mediation institute is not a sufficiently used alternative tool of settling disputes.
Despite there is a number of positive circumstances influencing wider usage of mediation (overloaded courts, lower financial costs), there are obstacles in the full application thereof on the legislative (absence of an execution title of a mediation agreement, facultative mediation), as well as non-legislative level (low awareness, tendency to consuetudinary solving of conflict situations, lack of trust in mediation).
In this context, the Centre addressed general courts in Slovakia regarding issues in connection with practice in the field of mediation.
From their point of view there was no “important and measurable contribution of mediation”.
The responses indicate that the attitude towards mediation is differentiated.
At district courts there are apparently not that many activities aimed at promoting mediation as a means of out-of-court dispute resolution.
The Centre addressed the Centre for Legal Assistance which offers mediation services in the framework of improving access to justice for people in material need and asked them to evaluate the application practice in the field of mediation.
The Centre provided mediation in 10 cases last year in the field of civic, family, and occupational relations.
From what has been stated so far we may conclude that in Slovakia it has not been possible so far to take full advantage of the potential of mediation being the alternative way of dispute resolution improving assess to justice for everybody.
6. EXTREMISM
The increase in manifestations of intolerance motivated by hatred towards members of other races, nations, nationalities, or ethnic groups or religions or towards people with different looks or views was a real problem last year not only in Slovakia.
The Centre considers it important to deal with the topic into more detail in a separate chapter predominantly due to the fact that xenophobia, intolerance, and extremisms are perceived as a problem by an ever growing group of population in Slovakia.
From the point of view of human rights this is a comprehensive topic concerning a broad spectrum of rights and freedoms ranging from the right to human dignity, freedom of speech, to the right of assembly and association, and others.
Despite the fact that there is no unified definition of extremism, according to the “Concept of combating extremism”140 the manifestations thereof include verbal, graphic, physical or other activities usually connected with a an extreme ideological or other context carried out by individuals or groups of persons with opinions that are clearly outside generally accepted societal standards with clear elements of intolerance, especially intolerance towards race, nationality, religion or other type of intolerance attacking democratic principles, social organisation, life, health, property or public order.
Extremism141 uses various ideological tools such as historical revisionism, social demagogy, radicalisms, support of verbal and physical violence towards opponents and towards defined social groups, or uses conspiracy theories.
Considering the fact that the issue of extremism is really topical in Slovakia, the Centre started monitoring the media continuously in 2008, paying special attention to manifestations of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism.
140 Draft Concept to Combat Extremism.
141 The term extremism is used too freely, according to experts, which makes the analysis of its manifestations complicated.
For more details see the Report on the Performance of Security Policy in the Field of Extremism.
This accentuates the constant need to not only monitor the manifestations but also actively support public discussion about these phenomena and make the general opinion thereof more sensitive.
The development in the field of extremism was last year influenced by a number of events and the measures resulting thereof.
What deserves to be mentioned in this context is the draft amendment of the Criminal Code that suggested that penalties be made stricter and more specified and that new definitions be introduced of some terms (for example offence in relation to extremism, extremist group, extremists material, etc.).
The said amendment was submitted for negotiation of the Government of the Slovak Republic already in April 2008.
The negotiation, however, was interrupted also in connection with negative reactions on the side of experts dealing with the issue of racially motivated crimes and crimes committed by members of neo-Nazi and extremist groups,144 and the amendments were therefore adopted at the meeting of the Government of the Slovak Republic in November 2008.
The Government draft Act that was submitted by the parliament to second reading in February 2009 was discussed by the Slovak Parliament's Judicial and Constitutional Committee and recommended for adoption.
The opinion of experts from non-governmental organisations draws attention, apart from other issues, to the fact that despite the draft amendment introduced new terms such as “extremist group” and “criminal acts of extremism”, the term extremism is defined neither in the amendment itself nor in the legislation of the EU member states.
In connection with the monitoring of the development of extremism manifestations in the last year, statistics mapping the occurrence of these phenomena are of great importance.
According to the data provided by the Police Corps Presidium, in 2008 there was the total of 213 racial crimes recorded in the Slovak Republic.
132 of them were clarified, and 218 persons were prosecuted.
There were 57 minor perpetrators, that is persons aged 14 - 18 years and 12 perpetrators were aged 6 - 14 years.
Bratislava : Inštitút pre občianske vzdelávanie, 2008, p. 50.
145 According to the Report on the Activity of the Prosecutor's Office of the Slovak Republic for the year 2007 (the report for the last year has not been published so far) the increasing number of criminally prosecuted persons due to this type of criminal activity is not exclusively the manifestation of an increase in this type of crime,146 but also the result of the increased activity of police authorities and prosecutors in the past few years.
The measures adopted by the police corps probably connected with the increase in this type of criminal acts in this area included a number of organisation changes.
The aim of these changes was to optimise and create effective conditions and tools to eliminate the criminal activity of extremists.
In June 2008 a department for combating extremism and youth crime was established at the Office of Judicial and Criminal Police of the Police Corps Presidium.
At departments of criminal police of the offices of judicial and criminal police of the police corps regional directorates in Bratislava, Košice, Banská Bystrica, Prešov, Trnava, Nitra, and Trenčín units of extremism and youth were established in the course 2008 and the beginning of 2009.
Manifestations of Racially Motivated Violence
The police statistics mentioned above indicate that the number of racially motivated cases of bodily harm is not predominant in the total number of racially motivated criminal acts, but signalises that the present conditions are serious.
This is also proven by the media reflexion on racially motivated attacks in the last year.
According to the results of monitoring by the Centre one fifth of the monitored reports in this area dealt with this crime area.
She was verbally attacked by two men, who used vulgar language to mock and threaten her and followed her from the tram stop to the restaurant where she would hide.
The motive of their acting was the colour of skin of the young woman.
The perpetrators committed a number of such crimes.
There was an attack on the political scientist Grigorij M., in February 2008 in the centre of Bratislava.
145 Response of the Police Corps Presidium of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic of March 16th, 2009, ref.:PPZ-164-11/KA-2009.
After three years of investigation in this case, the senate of the district court in Bratislava started legal action against four defendants in October 2008.
As has been stated in the Report on the Fulfilment of Safety Policy in the field of extremism, increasing brutality of the attacks, and the participation of growing numbers of younger people in activities promoting extremist movements and the introduction of sophisticated methods of organisation and presentation of extremist ideas, let us presume that radicalism and extremism are
going to be spread also in the future.
Manifestations of Extremism and Anti-Semitism
Racially motivated violence is the most serious and the most media followed extremism phenomenon.
The occurrence thereof is based in the area of perhaps less frequently followed criminal acts in connection with instigation of hatred towards a nation , race or ethnic group and defamation of nation, race, and belief, and most of all with the support and promotion of groups suppressing fundamental rights and freedoms.
In the context of fundamental human rights and freedoms this concerns abuse of the freedom of speech, which may and should be limited in connection with the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (right to human dignity, personal honour, a pod.), of the state security, public order, public health, and morals.
In official statistics there predominantly are criminal acts connected with the support and promotion of groups suppressing fundamental rights and freedoms (178 cases last year), however, the media pays a lot less attention to this area.
Out of 507 reports recorded within the monitoring only 50 dealt with this area, despite the fact that the occurrence of these manifestations shows a rising tendency.
As regards the age and social structure of perpetrators showing extremist manifestations, according to the information of the Police Corps Presidium, this depends on the form of committing crime.
The so called street crime is usually committed by younger persons aged 14 - 25 years.
In this group there were students and unemployed youth with lower level of education coming from socially disadvantaged families.
148 Response of the Police Corps Presidium of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic of March as of March 16th, 2009, ref.: PPZ-164-11/KA-2009.
In this context we may not omit the statements of the Minister of Justice and the representative of the National Council of the Slovak Republic and the head of one of the parliamentary parties made concerning another representative of the National Council on September 4th, 2008 during the meeting of the National Council.
These were disparaging taunts concerning the Jewish ancestors of the representative affected, which caused a wave of disapproval not only in the parliament.
After the case appeared all over the media there were disapproving reactions showed by the Federation of Jewish Communities in Slovakia and the representatives of a civic association and the statement was also denounced by the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic on the day to commemorate the victims of Holocaust in the presence of the Ambassador of Israel, who expressed his being upset about the matter.
The Minister of Justice apologised in the end.
Internet, Freedom of Speech, and the Manifestations of Extremism
We have already pointed out in our last Report that the Internet, being the most up-to-date means of communication was connected with the risk of spreading manifestations of intolerance.
It indeed is a global space which, considering its anonymity and span, allows for a nearly uncontrollable exchange of information and lets some people believe that there are no penalties or recourses.
149 According to the information provided by the Police Corps Presidium the internet is widely issued on professional level also in this field.
There is a clear shift in internet usage and the usage of web tools not only by groups but also by individuals.
On websites predominantly in the USA, there are materials displayed that promote intolerance on the grounds of nationality, ethnicity, race, religion and views.
p.:PPZ-164-11/KA-2009
The high level of anonymity is a great problem in monitoring extremis websites.
Similarly, in publishing materials with intolerance promoting ideas on the internet, the methods used are more and more sophisticated, and are often based on consultations with lawyers in order to prevent conflict and confrontation with the state power represented by the police.
Considering that it is extremely important to intensify effort to strengthen the awareness about the issue among the young, so that they have the skills to use the internet and mobile communication in a responsible manner to prevent crime in connection with the usage of communication network.
Assembly of Extremists
There is a conflict between the fundamental human rights and freedoms and the abuse of the democratic right to public assembly that shows more and more often in Slovak towns.
In organising events with extremist undertone the tendencies continue on which we informed in the last report, namely the tendencies to gradually professionalise the organisation of such public events, gatherings and cultural and social events, which shows for example in the fact that the organisers often use legal consultancy provided by an advocate on the spot, or legal assistance while elaborating promotion materials, processing legal advice in form of guidebooks, legal consultancy before public production, and legal assistance in case activists are captured by the police.
Self governments usually have their hands tied in combating extremists abusing the right of assembly.
For example the cancelling of three planned meetings of Slovak Togetherness by the local authority of the town part Bratislava - Old Town resulted in legal disputed according to the information provided by the media.
The survey of some selected extremist activities is as follows.
151 Response of the Police Corps Presidium of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic of March as of March 16th, 2009, ref.: PPZ-164-11/KA-2008.
the end, was supposed to be held under the name March against Drugs.
The police arrested the organiser of the meeting in the morning due to another issue.
They listened to the original Slovak anthem played on a car audio.
The meeting, which was announced beforehand, was organised in the presence of the police.
April 26th, 2008 Skinheads met in the town of Bardejov.
The police monitored the event based on previous findings.
70 persons were checked.
There were approximately 120 men dressed in black participating in the event, holding Slovak flags and banners with inscriptions such as Freedom to Nationalism or Freedom to Speech and hailing similar slogans.
November 17th, 2007 A march for freedom was organised in Bratislava.
Despite the fact that the organisers distanced themselves from the extremist character of the event, many affiliates of Slovak Togetherness were attending.
The police had to act during the speech of a certain Czech, who was accused of promoting racism and the assembly was dissolved.
Armed demonstrators who were members of the Workers Party (Delnícká strana) tried to surround the Roma suburb of Janov.
Extremists were supported by the town's inhabitants.
Slovak extremists participated as well.
The former leader of Slovak Togetherness Marián K. held a speech a in which he sharply criticised the Roma.
Extremism at Sports Events
A special group of extremism manifestations - especially during the last year - were manifestations of extremism at sports events, especially at football matches.
This is also reflected in the fact that one third of the monitoring reports of the Centre dealt with this issue.
It is the pressure of the general public that is the precondition and guarantee that extremist movements shall be suppressed and pushed where they belong, beyond the margins of the society.
153 Out of all football clubs and associations we addressed, we only got an answer regarding the increase in fan violence from the Slovak Ice Hockey Association and the football club FC Spartak Trnava.
Special Part
PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL TREATMENT AND PROHIBITION OF
DISCRIMINATION
In 2008 the Slovak Republic proceeded to the amendment (further amendment) of some important acts such as the Anti-Discrimination Act, Court Fees Act and the Code of Civil Procedure.
This further transposition of the European anti-discrimination directives into the legal system of the Slovak Republic brought us closer to the objectives of the member states of the European Union so that the legislation of the Slovak Republic together with the execution of judicial powers leads to a more efficient and effective promotion of equality between individuals (groups) in the society and safeguard that they are protected from discrimination.
In the assessed period, like in the previous years, we may state that discrimination victims still suffer from lack of courage (will) to claim protection from discrimination through existing legal tools.
The reasons therefore may vary.
The necessity to act in a non-discriminatory manner and promote the principle of equal treatment stirred moods in the Slovak society also in 2008.
Apart from the repeated objections, the Committee presented some new objections in the formal notice.
The main argument was, that based on the broad concept of this ban unclear or absurd situations might arise in practice.
It did not define the basic concept of creating
It is possible to claim legal protection out of court by means of mediation, by filing actions in public interest, as well as through institutions dealing with the observance of principle of equal treatment, acting as an external participant to the judicial proceedings.
The means of legal protection mentioned above are elaborated in detail in the following parts of the report.
Positive action measures
The most discussed point of the amendment was the introduction of the so called temporary positive action measures (§ 8a Anti-Discrimination Act).
Within the intra-departmental review session a number of reviewing subjects (including the Centre) suggested that the list of persons entitled to adopt temporary positive action measures included not only state authorities, but also all subjects who are obliged entities under the AntiDiscrimination Act, for example municipalities, higher territorial units, employers, universities, etc..
These subjects are expected to act in a more flexible, efficient, and forthright manner and provide for a more realistic possibility of assessing the carried out measures.
However, these suggestions have not been taken into consideration yet and due to that the only entities entitled to adopt temporary positive action measures are state administration authorities.
In the course of 2008 the Centre did not record any report in the sense of the mentioned provision.
It was only possible based on the questions submitted by the Centre to relevant state administration authorities to gain some information to get an image of how the regulation is perceived by the subjects.
160 Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Education, Institute of Information and Prognoses of Education, Ministry of Construction and Regional Development, Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, Ministry of Transport, Posts and Telecommunications, Ministry of Agriculture, Head Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family.
Other answers included statements like: “in our opinion these are not considered temporary positive action measures under the Anti-Discrimination Act”, and other institutions understood the issue of adopting temporary positive action measures as adopting measures within their relations of state employees.
These answers, although they are not many, indicate that the authorised subjects themselves have no clear opinion on the temporary positive action measures under § 8a Anti-Discrimination Act, or the application thereof.
If we add the vaguely formulated obligation under § 8a par. 4 of the AntiDiscrimination Act on reporting to the Centre (without defining the parameters of these reports), we may state that that in this situation it is not possible to expect satisfactory fulfilment of this legal obligation by the authorised subjects.
It shall be therefore necessary in the next period to make the issue of implementing temporary positive action measures a subject of discussion not only to the engaged state institutions, but also the selfgovernment authorities and organisations dealing with human rights.
The clash of opinions might result in the suggestion of new practical methods or other changes in legislation to extend he group of persons adopting the said temporary positive action measures.
Extended Tasks of the Slovak National Centre for Human Rights
The activity of the Centre is closely connected to the application of the anti-discrimination legislation in the Slovak Republic.
Being an independent legal entity with a field of activity over the whole country, the Centre has got a supra-ministerial nature.
It is at the same time the national institution for the protection of human rights (a National Human Rights Institution) and the institution to promote equality (a National Equality Body).
The said amendment specified and extended the competences and tasks of the Centre.
New tasks were assigned to the Centre, such as the task to perform independent examinations and elaborate
The Centre, within the scope of the tasks assigned by law, being a monitoring, advisory, and education institution, established to protect human rights, and fundamental freedoms including the rights of the child and the principle of equal treatment under a special act (č.
365/2004 Coll.) in 2008, exerted their key activities also in the regions through 7 regional offices.
2. DISCRIMINATION GROUNDS
The amended Anti-Discrimination Act sets out that the observance of the principle of equal treatment lies in the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of gender, religion or belief, race, nationality or ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital or family status, colour of skin, language, political or other views, national or social background, property, gender or other status.
Discrimination on the Grounds of Gender
Prohibition of discrimination on the basis of gender is one of the oldest and most elaborate.
It also specified the admissible unequal treatment on the grounds of gender (in the field of providing goods and services, in setting the amount and calculation of insurance based on insurance and mathematical and statistical data, at the same time, however, the expenses in connection with pregnancy and maternity must not lead to differences in the amount of insurance and the calculation of insurance premium).
Despite the fact that there were not many recorded and handled cases of discrimination on the grounds of gender by authorities addressed by the Centre, we cannot conclude that we observed a significant improvement in the position of women in the field of occupational relations.
The employer may only in special cases terminate the employment by dismissing a pregnant woman, or a woman o maternity leave, or a male or female employee on parental leave, with a single parent employee taking care of a child of less than 3 years of age.
The Centre shares the opinion that pregnancy must not constitute a reason of terminating employment, not even in the trial period.
In case the circumstances of terminating employment with a pregnant employee suggest that if she were not pregnant, the employment would not be terminated by the lapsing of the agreed period (but would be prolonged) it is possible to consider such case discrimination due to pregnancy.
They usually find out that an employee is pregnant from other employees or from e-mail or other type of communication.
For the purposes of this Act a pregnant employee is an employee who had informed their employer about the pregnancy in writing and produced a doctor's certificate to prove the condition.
The stated argument, however, is not sufficient and does not excuse the discriminatory character of such handling.
Another persistent problem is the discrimination of women in the field of remuneration.
The lower wages are reflected in a lower pension paid to women which results in the fact that in the group of women over 65 years of age 21 % face poverty compared to 16 % of men.
The Report of he National Labour Inspectorate on the Results of Labour Inspection in the field of “Strengthening Equal Opportunities - equal pay for equal work for men and women” for the year 2008 indicates that last year labour inspectorates accepted 23 suggestions163 objecting discrimination in equal remuneration.
Violation of § 119a of the Labour Code was found in 4 cases.
The low number of suggestions may be explained by the fact that employees usually have no clear idea about the wages of their co-workers.
The low percentage of determined differences in remuneration is explained by the National Labour Inspectorate by the hidden differences in the part of remuneration called “bonuses”, whereby the criteria of granting bonuses allow for subjective criteria to be applied in the assessment made by the head of department.
Equal pay for equal work or work of equal value concerns work of equal or comparable complexity carried out under equal or comparable conditions and equal performance and results achieved in doing the job for one employer.
The application of the principle of equal treatment was violated predominantly in the case of Roma minority in labour relations and similar relations and in the provision of goods and services.
The Centre was dealing with cases where the Roma ethnicity was the main reason behind the decision not to accept a job applicant.
The proof of that is a case of a Roma woman who applied for a job of a sales assistant in a clothes store.
The Centre in cooperation with the Center for Civil and Human Rights in Košice performed a testing in April 2008 during a job interview, which verified that there was discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity.
The Roma applicant fulfilled more qualification criteria and had worked in the field before for several years and had more work experience and better connection to travel to work and would have to travel shorter distance to work.
The inspection consisted of two separate attempts to obtain goods and services.
The waitress did not verify whether the two were members or not.
Right after those two Roma citizens showed up and ordered beer, but the waitress refused to serve them.
165 Letter from the National Labour Inspectorate of March 16th, 2009.
During the first attempt the two inspectors were served properly, and received a receipt.
During the attempt two Roma entered the pub, they were served as well, and consumed their drinks on the spot.
More Roma who entered the pub afterwards were refused.
These cases clearly prove that being Roma and having a skin of colour are among the most serious reasons behind a disadvantaged position not only on the labour market, but also in other areas of social life.
They prevent normal coexistence and respect between national minorities and the majority group.
Discrimination on the Grounds of Disability
Among the most vulnerable society members are the persons with disabilities.
Under the said Article persons with disabilities have the right to special protection in occupational relations, the right to assistance in vocational training, and increased protection of health at work as well as to special working conditions.
§ 6 of the Anti-Discrimination Act in connection with the observance of the principle of equal treatment in occupational relations and similar legal relations bans discrimination against persons on the grounds of their disability.
Paragraph 7 of the Anti-Discrimination Act obliges the employer to adopt appropriate measures in favour of persons with disabilities so that the working environment does not create conditions for inequality and discrimination.
This obligation may only be restricted in case the conditions of its application are inappropriately difficult for the employer.
A positive change in the status of persons with disabilities on the labour market was introduced on April 1st, 2008 when the amended Anti-Discrimination Act came into effect and when health disability started being considered a protected ground of discrimination in all areas of application of the Anti-Discrimination Act.
Since May 1st, 2008 the amended act on employment services came into effect, which includes a set of tools of active labour market policies targeted at eliminating the exclusion of disadvantaged groups of job applicants from the labour market.
According to the amendment, every citizen has the right to access to employment without any restrictions, in compliance with the principle of equal treatment.
Many employers are not sufficiently informed about active labour policy tools.
The arguments they use while refusing a disabled job applicant most often include the cost of creating or adjusting a job, administrative burden connected with the accounting of single benefits and issuance of necessary certificates, frequent absence of persons with disabilities at work, wok safety and health protection, protection during layoff, lower adaptability to work regime, lower work production, and limited social communication at work.
According to the findings made by the Council, the employers have no interest in general to employ persons with disabilities.
The disadvantage here is the low education level and missing skills of disabled job seekers over 40 years of age, who have been affected since early childhood or before maturity.
The lasting trend followed by the employers on the labour market is the underestimation of the skills of persons with disabilities, as well as a certain mental barrier and prejudice.
The legal regulations of the Slovak Republic do not directly discriminate against persons with disabilities; however, they do not provide them with sufficient protection from hidden discrimination.
The adoption of the Action Plan to Implement he UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities elaborated by the National Council of Persons with Disabilities in the Slovak Republic in 2007 is still pending.
In 2008 the Centre was dealing with three instigations by persons with disabilities.
A female celiatic client objected discrimination, since her employer refused to provide her with meal tickets.
She also objected inappropriate and offending behaviour on the side of her female superior.
The disputes at work resulted in a dismissal of the employee due to organisation reasons, which was withdrawn by the employer.
A male client who worked in the banking sector in various positions quit his job by means of agreement that was forced upon him.
He decided to sue his former employer due to discrimination and claim a non-material loss.
At the moment he is a disadvantaged job seeker.
He asked the Centre to provide him with expert counselling and also asked the Centre to be present at the hearings in the role of expert public.
Another client, also from the banking sector also objected discriminatory action on the side of a former employer.
The result of the discriminatory action was the termination of the occupational relation due to violation of labour discipline.
The client filed an action, claiming that the termination of his labour relation be announced invalid and claiming protection from discrimination.
The Centre provided the client and his attorney with legal consultations.
In 2008 the town police in Žilina employed six persons with disabilities, who now follow what is going on in various parts of the town on screens via the camera supervision system from their protected workshop.
Based on what has been stated above, the Centre agrees with the opinion of the Central Office of Labour, which says that the situation of persons with disabilities on the labour market could be improved by establishing a network of rehabilitation and requalification centres, by making the payments and allowances more advantageous for those employers who employ persons with disabilities, by safeguarding a barrier free access into all buildings of the central office of labour, social affairs and the family.
What could also help improve the status of the disabled on the labour market is the possible change in the education system, so that not only primary school is obligatory for them, but also vocational school, professional qualification at training schools of various types.
What could also be a contribution is the support and better usage of services of mediation agencies specialising in helping certain target groups including the groups of persons with disabilities.
Discrimination on the Grounds of Age
The prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of age has been introduced into secondary EU legislation recently,168 despite the fact that every person might be a victim of this type of discrimination at a certain stage in life.
Since April 1st, 2008 the prohibition of discrimination due to age relates, apart from occupation and employment, also to the field of social security, healthcare, education and provision of goods and services.
Age, either high or low (in graduates) is, according to research and the experience made by the employees of the Centre, one of the risk factors on the labour market and most frequent causes of
discrimination in occupational relations.
This is confirmed by the results of Eurobarometer 2008, whereby in Slovakia, discrimination due to age is perceived more intensely compared to other countries.
The representative research of how people perceive human rights and the principle of equal treatment in adult population in the Slovak Republic carried out by the Centre in 2008 indicates that 61.6 % of the respondents have a personal or reported experience with discriminatory behaviour considering the act of not accepting or dismissing an employee due to higher age.
168 Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.

Final report to the research.
Bratislava : Slovenské národné stredisko pre ľudské práva, 2009, p. 46.
The approach towards the education of senior employees, which is the research carried out by the Institute for Labour and Family Research, points out to the approach of employers towards the necessity to educate senior citizens.
The increasing level of education, new skills, and requalification are seen as necessary to keep a job or position by senior employers by two thirds of employers (68.8%).
At the same time, most employers (nearly two thirds) do not make it possible for the employees to attend requalification courses.
The main argument the employers are using to excuse this is their claiming that they “need experts” (69.9%), and that the “development of vocational skills is the responsibility of the employees alone” (55.4%), that “requalification is unnecessary since the requirements for a certain position do not change” (54.2%).
According to the majority of employers
the chances for education are the same with the older and the younger employees.
In 2008 the Centre dealt with a case of indirect discrimination due to age.
In December 2007 the representatives of the town council adopted a resolution under which they, apart from the conditions set out by law, determined an age limit of employing town policemen of 35 years, and 45 years in case of the chief police officer.
According to the minutes of the meeting, the female mayor of the town used her authority to suspend the resolution due to suspected violation of the law.
The representatives voted repeatedly and the resolution was passed by the majority of votes.
The Act on Police sets out the minimum criterion for employing members of (town) police, including the lower age limit of 21 years, integrity, physical, mental and professional ability.
The Act does not set out the maximum age limit for the performance of the job of a town policeman.
The Centre classified the requirement stated in the resolution as indirect discrimination and sent a notification to the town council in March 2008 recommending that such resolution be abolished.
The town council took the said notification into consideration, but the cited resolution remained in effect.
Due to that the Centre elaborated a notice in 2008 on the lack of compliance of the resolution with the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination Act and sent it to the responsible

Final report of the research project No. 2131.

prosecutor's office.
The research carried out in 2007 by the Institute for Public Affairs within the project titled Identifying barriers of a more effective usage of anti-discrimination legislation in relation to the (long term) unemployed pointed out that there is prejudice and negative stereotypes towards the unemployed.
Persons aged over 45 - 50 years are more subjected to discrimination on the labour market, whereby women of this age face more types of discrimination, not only on the grounds of age but also on the grounds of gender.
“Employing people over 50 years of age was presented by the employers as a virtue of necessity, since younger employees are not capable ofperforming some types of works due to missing skills.
Such opinions on the side of the employers were present also in 2008.
Discrimination Due to Other Reasons
In the course of 2008 the Centre was dealing with a case of harassment at work which resulted in employment termination in the trial period, the reason being the fact that the woman lived in a crisis centre and had no permanent stay.
The Centre assessed the said situation as discrimination due to social background and other status, namely the absence of permanent stay.
One of the factors limiting access to the labour market is long-term unemployment of both male and female job seekers.
Long term unemployment mostly affects the opposite age groups,
Bratislava : Inštitút pre verejné otázky IVO, 2007, s. 39.
Other factors prolonging long-term unemployment are education and gander.
The higher the level of education, the lower the risk of longterm unemployment.
A negative trend aggravating the situation in long-term unemployment of women is the tendency to “feminise” long-term unemployment.
The experience of the Centre and its regional offices, the findings of the research and the everyday practice of competent institutions indicate that discrimination most often occurs in occupational relations.
The same experience was mentioned by the National Labour Inspectorate in Košice, which in 2008 received 83 suggestions objecting discrimination, whereby 26 of them were substantiated.
In 46 cases it was recommended that the cause be brought before the court.
As stated by the National Labour Inspectorate, compared to 2007 the number of instigations objecting discrimination in the area of occupational relations increased by 22 %, whereby the number of cases which were assessed as cases of discrimination decreased by 62 %.
All institutions addressed by the Centre agreed that discrimination is very hard to prove.
What they consider the only solution is the possibility to prove discrimination within the judicial proceedings.
More competences are necessary to determine whether there was violation of the anti-discrimination legislation, than the labour inspectorate has at their disposal (employees who are still employed refuse to provide information, the labour inspectorate must keep the identity of the complainant secret, etc.).
There is therefore no doubt that such issues should be brought before the court.”
The present legal protection of male and female employees under the Labour Code and the Anti-Discrimination Act seems sufficient in most of the addressed institutions.
The repeated representative research of how people perceive the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms and of the principle of equal treatment in adult population of the Slovak Republic carried out in 2008 by the Centre indicates that 60 % of respondents do have an experience, or know of somebody with an experience with discrimination in occupational relations on the grounds of age, especially as regards new employment and job termination.
Nearly 16% of the respondents stated that the employer questioned them about the number of children and their ages during the job
interview.
Discriminative Job Offers and Advertisements
This legal provision results in the obligation of employers to publish job offers in form of job advertisements in compliance with the principle of equal treatment.
176 Letter from the National Labour Inspectorate in Košice of March 16th, 2009.
The Centre therefore addressed the offices of labour, social affairs and the family and the Central the office of labour, social affairs and the family in a letter, asking whether they determined violation of the act in this field either within their activity or based on an incentive.
The responses indicated that no claim was made and their own control activity revealed no such violation.
According to the statement of the Central the office of labour, social affairs and the family job advertisements are not monitored.
The advertisements very often contain job requirements regarding certain sex, and gender stereotypes in connection with certain job positions that are often perceived as typically “female” or typically “male”.
Many of them contain requirements which may be assessed as discriminative on the grounds of age, race, ethnicity, etc..
A female employee of the regional office of the Centre carried out a research in December 2008 and January and February 2009 to analyse job advertisements and determine the occurrence of discriminative requirements set by employers and job agencies regarding age.
30 150 job advertisements from 9 sources were analysed (web job portals, regional weeklies, dailies, websites of the offices of labour, social affairs and the family).
She focused on the occurrence of directly discriminative requirements such as age, and also on other factors that may be considered indirect discrimination or factors which might have a discriminative impact on both male and female job seekers such as young team, long-term experience in practice, or maximum limits set to the duration of practice, the necessity to produce a current photograph, etc..
Some offers included the requirement of long-term experience.
Some offers defined the experience as follows: “we are looking for a person with at least 10 years ofpractice”; in some cases that would be 15 or 20 years for positions such as official, assistant, electrician, carpenter, etc..
Some companies were looking for a “fresh and dynamic person” or a “skilled, communicative person with a spark ”; in most cases this concerned the position of a company representative, or a representative of a pharmaceutical company.
One job offer looking for a shop assistant to operate the cash desk did not include a specific age but there was a note that this job was also: “suitable for middle aged job seekers”, and another job offer stated that the job was “suitable also for pensioners ”.
A job offer searching a real estate agent did not require a certain age but stated the following at the end: “We ask the job seekers to respect our requirements regarding age and experience in the field. ”
“Other advantages: young team. ”
A job offer for the position of a cleaning lady read: “In case of interest state your age as
This is the working of a job offer seeking company representatives and employees in the field of providing services: “We are a dynamic, young and creative team of people who want to improve the quality of services and coffee and we are giving you a chance to become one of us.
A job offer looking for an assistant worker in a printing company offered ‘“work without age limit ”, but continued by stating that: ”only girls shall be accepted. ”
A job offer looking for a shop assistant announced that ''age is not a precondition for skills”, but asked for a specific age group “from 22 to 50 years. ”
The research carried out by the Centre also revealed that most citizens (more than 60 %) agree that employers must not publish job offers with discriminative requirements.
The approach of the labour offices to the disadvantaged job seekers
This regards mainly discrimination at job interviews, or dismissal
on the grounds of high age, pregnancy, or Roma ethnicity.
These are the most frequently used reasons of not employing a disadvantaged job seeker:
• Filled vacancy/full staffing
• Lack of experience
• Failure to fulfil the requirements
• Lack of working habits
• Failure to fulfil qualification requirements
• Lack of social adaptability
• Lack of willingness to commute
• Failure to meet the ideas of the employer
• Obstacles on he side of the job seeker
The employers do not speak openly about such reasons.
They use vague and general formulations to hide the true reasons such as age or Roma ethnicity.
Employers in general do not rust job seekers registered at labour offices and it is therefore difficult to prove whether there is discrimination or lack of trust in the skills and qualities of such job seekers.
The unemployed often feel more protected by job agencies compared to labour offices, since it is the agency who decides about the position of the job seeker and the “party ordering the service” the employer is not left with so much room for changes or discrimination.
This helps eliminate potential discrimination.
Under the amended act on employment services, labour offices shall use agencies to improve the situation and increase the level of protection against discrimination.
• Anti-discrimination clauses in codes of ethics
The Codes of Ethics have become a modern tool in many organisations, which, apart from the work regulations, is used to set out the principles, objectives, values and rules of the company.
179 Letter from the Head Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of March 17th, 2009, ref.:
The Code of Ethics usually governs the principles of the company in relation to partners and clients and sets out the rules of building the goodwill of a company, governs the relations with the employees and obliges them to adhere to the general moral principles as well as specific rules defined by the company.
By signing the code of ethics an individual or a company undertakes to adhere to specific rules and procedures.
The code is not a legally binding document, however, the failure to adhere thereto may lead to measures and sanctions being imposed (for example by decreasing the personal remuneration of the employee, negative publicity of the company, or exclusion form associations).
In 2008 the Centre recorded codes of ethics developed nearly in all areas or segments of the labour market.
Codes of Ethics for employees, occupational groups, associations, self-governments, state administration authorities, trade unions etc oblige the entities to adhere to the legislation valid in the territory of the Slovak Republic, observe human rights, the principle of equal treatment and the prohibition of discrimination, to create conditions to for harmonising family and work life and adhere to general principles of morality.
On the one hand it is satisfactory that anti-discrimination clauses are a natural part of Codes of Ethics.
On the other hand it is necessary to add that a Code of Ethics is only a declaratory document of an organisation or society, promoting ideas of non-discrimination, tolerance and human rights.
In order for the Code to have effect on the promotion of the principle of equal treatment it must be adopted together with a set of intercompany mechanisms to safeguard adherence thereto.
In the future it shall be interesting to examine the direct impact of anti-discrimination clauses on the elimination of discriminative and intolerant manifestations in occupational relations contained in the codes of ethics of selected organisations.
services and education.
The amended Anti-Discrimination Act in effect from April 1st, 2008 extended
180 Under Act. No. 80/2008 Coll. the original reasons taken over from Directives (sex, religion or belief, race, nationality or ethnicity, disability, age or sexual orientation) were extended by protected grounds of discrimination such as marital or family status, colour of skin, language, political or other views, national or social background, property, gender or other status
Social security relates to the provision of social assistance, social insurance, old-age pension, retirement saving, supplementary retirement saving, state social subsidies, and social advantages.
In the course of the year 2008 the Centre was contacted by a number of people objecting discrimination on the side of Social Insurance House or the responsible office of labour, social affairs and the family.
After inspecting the suggestions discrimination was not found.
Such suggestions mostly concerned the duration of the decision making process regarding a certain title, disapproval with the opinion of a medical specialist or a decision passed by an authority or court or dissatisfaction with a legal regulation.
In 2008 the Centre was also dealing with the objected disadvantaging of widow or widower pensioners at the provision of the Christmas benefit, who are not anymore entitled to receive the said Christmas benefit in case they receive a widow or widower pension, and the sum of the two types of pension exceeds a certain limit.
The claim was based on the fact that the widow or widower pension persons have to bear practically the same housing and household related costs (water, electricity, gas, etc.) as those living in couples, and in many cases they are not entitled to the Charismas benefit.
No discrimination was found in this case either.
The Charismas benefit being a special state benefit is aimed at improving the social situation of a certain group of pensioners who are dependant on that type of support, and is only provided to persons the sum of pensions of which does not exceed the given amount181.
therapy to patients with multiple sclerosis and the existing age limitation related thereto.
What is a special issue in the field of healthcare provision is the bad health condition of the Roma living in settlements.
The Office of the Plenipotentiary participated actively in 2008 in the programme implemented by the Ministry of Health in cooperation with the Public Health Authority of the Slovak Republic titled “Programme to Support the Health of Underprivileged Communities in Slovakia for the Years 2007 - 2015”.
As to December 31st, 2008 the first stage of the project was carried out.
In 2008 there were 10 coordinators and 20 medical assistants working in the field, which is a number too small considering the real needs in practice.
The Centre recorded incentives in the field of healthcare provision that mainly concerned disapproval of the handling of a medical practitioner or refusal to treat a patient from another region.
In connection with the objected violation of the principle of equal treatment the Slovak Trade Inspection registered 75 suggestions, out of which 19 proved as substantiated, 42 were assessed as unsubstantiated, 4 are being handled and 10 were referred to relevant responsible authorities.
A separate group of those who were refused service were persons with disabilities, where the problem isn't as much the unwillingness to serve such customer, but rather the unwillingness to adopt measures that would improve access of those people to the restaurant or pub, and especially the
184 The Roma live shorter, eat worse, and do no sports.
186 For ore information on the discrimination of the Roma in the area of access to goods and services see subchapter 2.2.
unwillingness to change the attitude towards people with disabilities.
Considering the existing legal regulation and societal development the providers of goods and services will have to realise their responsibilities in the creation of a barrier free society.
A positive example was shown by the Bratislava Transport Company that changed their approach and introduced the obligation to help mothers with trolleys and the disabled when entering the vehicle based on the suggestions they received.
We shall further comment on that later on (Implementation of anti-discrimination legislation into the transportation rules of the transport companies in the Slovak Republic).
Apart from other observations, the report indicates that 99.5 percent out of 200 pupils in a specialised school in Pavlovce nad Uhom is of Roma origin.
One of the reasons behind the placing of Roma children into specialised schools is the alleged inadequate level of speaking the majority language.
187 Letter from the Bratislava Transport Company recorded on March 17th, 2009 under No. 506.
188 Act No. 245/2008 Coll. on Education and Upbringing (School Act) as amended.
Segregation of the Roma in the system of special education in Slovakia.
London : Amnesty International, 2008, p. 6.
The reason here is the concern of the school regarding their preparedness to handle such situation considering staffing and competences.
The experience of the group representing the interest of the mentally challenged says that the main area of discrimination against the mentally challenged is education, whereas this area is most important since it paths the way to a normal life within the community and to the labour market.
In most European countries mentally challenged children are refused education at normal schools.
The situation in the Slovak Republic is similar.
Children may be provided with education in specialised schools, and the representatives of this group are aware of cases where these children are educated in integrated schools, but there are not that many of them.
These children follow an individual education plan and have an additional teacher and assistant.
Despite what has been said previously, in Slovakia there is a very limited number of education courses, usually carried out within projects.
There is no system of educating mentally challenged adults.
190 Further objections concern the decrease in the number of pupils at schools, which is not as significant as in classes of healthy children, whereby the numbers are set out only in the ordinance and not in the act, as is the case with healthy pupils.
The establishment thereof

was required by the Office of the Self-governing region of Banská Bystrica.
In 2005 the school moved to Môťovská cesta 5, Zvolen.
The moving of the school itself was reflected in a decreased number of attendants.
The low number of children resulted in lacking financial resources and finally in the decision of the self-governing region of Banská Bystrica to abolish the school.
The decision was passed at the meeting of regional representatives on April 10th, 2008.
On September 1st, 2008 the network of schools and school facilities was enriched by the Private Secondary Comprehensive School of eight grades and a private boarding house in Kremnica.
19 pupils from Kremnica, Bardejov, Svidník or Banská Bystrica were enrolled.
191 Letter from the Association of Roma Children and Youth in Poltár, recorded on April 14th, 2008 under No. 966.
193 Letter from the Ministry of Education recorded on September 5th, 2008 under No. 1964.
In this case the service is provided to the public by public and private subjects, usually for money.
Single areas of transport and transportation are governed in the Slovak Republic under special acts.
Trying to solve the problem, he and his parents contacted the transport company Slovaklines, a.s, however, the company would refer to the then valid transport regulation.
The situation was cleared during the negotiations with the general director and the transport regulation was amended.
The rule of transporting the maximum of one baby trolley has also been abolished however; the number of
trolleys depends on the circumstances named in the transport regulation of the transport company.
In connection with the case mentioned above the Centre addressed selected transport companies, private transport companies and the Railways of the Slovak Republic with questions regarding the number of suggestions objecting inappropriate approach to persons with disabilities, parents with children and the elderly.
changes had been made based on such complaints.
The Railways of the Slovak Republic informed us that every railway company had organisation and technical procedures in place should transport of persons with disabilities be required (immobile passengers).
In transporting those passengers they cooperate with the Railway Company Slovensko, which operates in the field of railway transport of persons.
Since the adjustment has been in effect, no claim was recorded by the Bratislava Transport Company objecting problems with the transportation of wheelchairs and baby trolleys.
Based on what has been mentioned above we may conclude that although there is no special regulation governing the transport of persons in the Slovak Republic that would oblige the companies to observe the principle of equal treatment, measures are being implemented to safeguard on a certain level the transport of persons with disabilities, the elderly, and parents (mothers) with baby trolleys.
The complaints filed by those groups of the society prove that the measures were adopted as a result of the complaints and not as a means of preventing inappropriate (unequal) treatment.
At the same time it is necessary to praise positive changes in the area, as well as the constructive approach of the transport companies to the solving of the situations mentioned above.
Everybody has the possibility to claim their rights before the court in case they believe their rights or interests or freedoms protected under the law or the principle of equal treatment have been violated.
They might claim that the person violating the principle of equal treatment cease their activity and where possible provide for redress or compensation.
Such persons can be represented before the court by the Centre or a legal entity active in the field of protection against discrimination.
Furthermore, it is necessary to prove the existence of a ground of discrimination based on which discrimination is banned.
All evidence produced by the parties shall be assessed by the court according the principle of free evaluation of evidence, in mutual relations and connections and passed a decision based on the finding.
200 For more information see subchapters 5.7 in the first part of the Report and 4.1 in the second part of the Report.
Mediation and Out-of-court Settlement of Disputes in Discrimination Cases
Selected disputes fulfilling the preconditions for mediation were mediated by the mediators of the Centre.
Within the project, 19 mediation proceedings took place at the Centre, in three cases that concerned mediation.
The dispute was solved in all cases.
Judicial Proceedings in Cases Related to the Violation of the Principle of Equal
In 2008 the Centre was contacted by those people who reported mobbing or bossing at workplace, at the termination of employment, or people dissatisfied with the conditions at work.
Some of them required that a claim be filed objecting violation of the principle of equal treatment and asked the Centre to represent them before the court.
In the previous year the media informed of the cases that were tackled by the civic association Center for Civil and Human Rights.
In February 2008 the Center for Civil and Human Rights and the civic association Nová cesta published a report dealing with the decision of the court in the case of discrimination of the Roma in the cafe IDEA in Michalovce.
The regional court in Košice being the court of appeal revoked the decision of the district court (of August 31st, 2006) and the case was returned before the district court in Michalovce for further substantiation.
Based on the information on the status and number of cases related to the violation of the principle of equal treatment under the Anti-Discrimination Act gained for the year 2008 we may only state that the situation has not changed much in the said year.
It would not have been possible to meet the task without the cooperation of all public administration authorities (ranging from central state administration authorities to municipal authorities), public institutions, the academia, and nongovernmental organisations operating it eh field of human rights.
We would like to thank all authorities and institutions named in Annex 1 for their cooperation, approach, and useful underlying documents.
In 2008 many acts were either adopted or amended and influenced substantially the implementation and observance of human rights, especially in the area of social rights, education, asylum law, anti-discrimination law and the observance of the principle of equal treatment.
Based on the facts given in the Report it is possible to conclude that no serious violation of human rights occurred in the Slovak Republic in 2008.
Even though our Report points out some problems and lacks in the application of some human rights and fundamental freedoms in Slovakia in 2008.
Unfortunately, some of them are chronic, such as delays in judicial proceedings, and others are new or growing (racial crime, manifestations of extremism at sports events, etc.).

Foreword
After the lapse of another calendar year, the Slovak National Centre for Human Rights has prepared and presents to public a "Report on the Observance of Human Rights including the Observance of the Principle of Equal Treatment and Rights of the Child in the Slovak Republic for the Year 2012".
The year 2012 has proved that in the Slovak Republic the rights of people who are the most vulnerable, defenceless and disadvantaged are becoming increasingly threatened.
The State undertook to prevent the non-observance and violation of human rights of such weak, vulnerable and disadvantaged groups before the international community.
It undertook to protect them and create special conditions for full-valued exercise of their human rights and freedoms.
The State voluntarily undertook to perform such obligations by a complicated procedure in executive powers, Parliament and on the level of the Chief of State, whereas as a high State Party it deposited its undertaking in a deposit of the international community.
Paradoxically, Slovak practice provides the least protection to the three most numerous groups of population.
The most lagging is the protection provided to children, handicapped and to the members of marginalized communities.
In figures it means that of a total Slovak population of 5 million 400 thousand, the protection of children is lagging, which accounts for Imilon 100 thousand, i.e. 20 %, or one fifth of the population.
The protection of 8% of inhabitants is lagging from among persons with severe disabilities and other several percent of people with minor disabilities.
However, also the protection of the rights of members of a numerous Roma minority is insufficient, which according to some estimates presents even roughly 10% of the population.
In 2012, it was not possible to hear children, but adults were talking about child victims.
Certain parents, media, certain experts and politicians broke silence with their complaints, testimonies and interest in child victims.
Statements and opinions of those responsible for child victims stayed not spoken.
In the period under review, the Slovak public showed sudden interest in the rights and destiny of children, and it seems that this interest could be more stable and long-term thanks to the media.
The disabled were silent in the preceding period.
However, the silence does not attest that these people are satisfied.
On the contrary, findings in 2012 indicate that this group suffers from many unsolved problems, and also immense longterm disadvantages, weakening and financial exhaustion.
However, it appears that it suffers also from huge unconcern of society.
In comparison with children, nothing and nobody disturbed the quiet silence about the issue of non-observance of the rights of persons with disabilities.
The majority was not "disturbed" by the issues and needs of this large group, did not become aware of the current information about them, and significantly did not embark upon benefits for such people.
Practically this numerous part of Slovak population was left unnoticed and without interest of society.
In comparison with the children and disabled persons, in 2012, we could hear the members of the Roma minority.
However, we could hear much more the louder majority society, which showed special interest in the Roma.
The absence of silence in Slovakia presented often unilateral complaints, statements, opinions, attitudes or organized procedures of public or private representatives, which, however, created only minimum space for a dialogue and yet smaller space for useful solutions.
Walking on a pavement in front of Asian migrants crossing the Slovak state border and the Eastern Carpathian Schengen border at the place of contact with external environment of the European Union, we must remind of recently published freezing data from the colleagues of the Asian centre for human rights.
According to these data, in a period between 2001 and 2011, the number of raped children in India grew by 336%, whereas even 48 338 cases were reported in the said decade.
Published data and foreign conditions may appear despicable to an average European, but miles apart.
The Slovak National Centre for Human Rights claims that the problem of the protection of a man in Europe and Slovakia consists in inconsistent performance of international obligations of the State to protect people regardless of geography, demography, religion, culture, tradition or other specific differences and self-satisfying comparison.
Events in Slovakia in 2012, however, revealed a gap in the state protective system of minor children with their possible disappearance from the centre of Slovak society, failure in the protection against unilateral withdrawing of Slovak children abroad, but also suspected failures in the transfers of Slovak children from abroad in bilateral interstate adoptions.
Despite the disclosure of such system failures of the state, however, neither in 2012 did Slovakia establish the institute of ombudsman for children, though the UN recommended it to Slovakia twice urgently in 2000 and 2007, and also the Slovak National Centre for Human Rights in its 2012 campaign.
The life of the Roma in Slovakia has been accompanied by the culture of poverty in the long term, which has changed to the cult of poverty.
Other new trends join the poverty of the Roma in Slovakia.
Even though the Centre has directed attention to the trend of residential segregation on a regular basis since 2009, and appeals to its stoppage; the number of anti-Roma walls in Slovakia did not drop in 2012 either.
But on the contrary, their construction has a growing trend.
One anti-Roma wall of which we learn develops in Slovakia every quarter.
Even Eastern Slovak towns and villages as the pioneers of the model of isolating walls have become a model for self-governments in Central and Western Slovakia.
The public is a witness to gradual import of the model of anti-Roma walls into the whole interior country.
Paradoxically, right at the same period between police cordons in the presence of TV staff, the Police president obstructed arbitrary and violent demolition of Roma settlements.
In addition to residential segregation and an attempt for the eradication of Roma settlements, the critical Report documents segregation and discrimination of Roma pupils along with facts about the conditions in the Slovak school system.
It took two long years after the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to gradually start to fulfil implementation obligations, and the State established a main contact point for the implementation of the Convention in one of the ministries.
Holdouts are gloomy, but the result is exciting.
Thus in 2012, the State created space for a dialogue, which inspires hope that the obstacles and barriers impeding the integration of handicapped persons in everyday life will not deepen more, but on the contrary, gradually will disappear.
Although the critical Report documents uncoordinated efforts of institutions, it also provides specific steps which are significant for examples of good practice.
However, it is only a beginning of a long journey prepared by the ratification of the Convention in 2010.
In 2012, Slovakia allowed the handicapped to go only to the starting line in front of a hurdle race track, the finish of which they cannot see yet.

FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
Introduction
The purpose of the Report is to provide a fair, true and current image of the observance of human rights in the Slovak Republic for the previous year and also give opinions and recommendations to ensure more efficient protection and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Pursuant
Within Slovak society, the Centre has an extraordinary and special position.
In the international context, it acts as a national organization for human rights within the United Nation system.
Within the EU framework, the Centre represents a specialized National Equality Body in the Slovak Republic, involved in the trans-European EQUINET network.
Thus on the basis of its position the Centre monitors and evaluates the
observance of human rights and fundamental rights including the rights of the child, as well as the observance of the principle of equal treatment in the Slovak Republic.
Particular chapters of the Report on the Observance of Human Rights including the Observance of the Principle of Equal Treatment and Rights of the Child in the Slovak Republic for the Year 2012 deal with human rights and freedoms, the issue of extremism, the observance of the principle of equal treatment, and such issues as discrimination and the rights of the child.
The content of Report specifically focuses on selected human rights and freedoms which were the subject of public discussions in 2012, for which imperfections occurred in their application in practice, or for which protection appeared to be problematic in the past year.
general information on the guarantee of rights, provides for the most significant international and national legal regulations, and in some cases also rulings of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic and judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.
The purpose of the Report is to provide a fair, true and current image of the observance of human rights in the Slovak Republic for the previous year and also give opinions and recommendations to ensure more efficient protection and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
For the above reason, in preparing the Report the Centre contacted a wide circle of public authorities, public institutions, non-governmental organizations acting in the field of human rights, and the academic world, to give an opinion on specific issues and provide source documents and information.
Both documents became effective in the Slovak Republic on 25 June 2010.
The Convention presents a philosophical and legal completion of a transition from a medical model to a social model of health disabilities on the basis of exercise of human rights.
Its preamble says it in the following text: "disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others."
In other words, the Convention recognizes disability as a result of insufficient respect and adaptation of society to individual differences of its members.
The Convention confirms that persons with disabilities have a right to the recognition of their person as an individual with rights and admits that persons with disabilities have legal capacity in all areas of life on a basis being equal to the others.
It promotes a transition from representation to support in making decisions, if needed.
The definition of terms "disability", or a "person with disabilities" is not clearly enshrined in the Slovak system of law.
Chapter 1.
Pursuant to Article 2 l) of the cited Act, a child/pupil with health disability shall be understood as a child or pupil with a mental handicap, auditory handicap, visual handicap, physical handicap, with disturbed communication ability, with autism or other pervasive developmental disorders, or with multiple handicaps;

The time period for discussions regarding the Initial Report of the Slovak Republic on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is not known according to the Ministry.
Each Ministry was asked for immediate appointment of their contact persons and for the submission of a report on legislative proposals and changes in the areas of rights of persons with disabilities until 30.06.2013.
It was recommended to other organizations including the Centre to continuously collaborate with the main contact point in performing activities resulting from the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
It is expected from the main contact point that it will participate in the preparation of a new "National Programme of Living Conditions Development for Persons with Disabilities", the purpose of which is to ensure the maximum level of social inclusion for persons with disabilities and their families through systematic implementation of the policies of the Government, self-governments and other responsible entities, with full participation of persons with disabilities and their representative organizations at all levels of society.
Assessment of Replies with Respect to the Preparation of Chapter on the Implementation of Convention
In January 2013, the Centre contacted a total of 44 entities19 with a request
Just like in the past year, questions sent to the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the SR and to the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR and to other selected ministries related in particular to the implementation of Articles 33 (government coordination mechanism, independent monitoring mechanism and involvement of civic society), 35 (preparation of a comprehensive implementation report for the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities), 31 (collection and dissemination of information including statistical and research data), as well as to the implementation of particular provisions of Articles 5 30 Convention in the context of legislative changes.
The entities of self-government authorities were contacted again with respect to evaluating the current status of the implementation on their level and the status of eliminating barriers in an access to public institutions.
We asked non-governmental organizations representing the interests of people with disabilities to evaluate the status of the implementation of the Convention, about the degree of their involvement in the relevant legislative process (as part of the amendment procedure), and for conditions of the involvement of citizens with disabilities in society in 2012.
Until the middle of April 2013, the Centre reported answers from 27 entities (61.4%), whereas upon invitation from the Union of Towns and Cities of Slovakia, 11 towns sent us answers about the current status of implementation of the Convention on the level of self-governments.
SK 8 Association of Self-Governing Regions, Bratislava Self-Governing Region, Slovak Humane Council, Slovak Union of Supported Employment,
Thanks to this the Centre has answers from 11 different towns, which relate to the implementation of the Convention on the self-governmental level.
Collected information from particular reports on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for 2012 is extremely interesting, comprehensive and its content exceeds the limits devoted to the topic within the submitted Report.
In attempting to present to the recipients of this Report as objective information as possible, the Centre decided to publish the summary information on the current status of the implementation of the Convention in a special monographic report which will be published at its website.
For such reasons in this presented Report we only publish key information from the central bodies of state administration and an evaluation of the implementation process as regards the non-governmental sector.
The reported data from self-government bodies will constitute the principal part of the above mentioned monographic report.

it recommended immediate creating of conditions for the establishment of a main contact point for the coordination of the implementation of Convention.
The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR was to present the relevant material for negotiations of the Slovak Government, which was to inform of the developments on the past session of the Slovak Government Council for Human Rights, National Minorities and Gender Equality on 27 February 2013.
The Centre also wanted to know what specific steps were taken in 2012 with respect to establishing contact points for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
In the context of the question, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR (hereinafter the "MLSAF sR")23 directs attention to the
23 Statement of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family regarding the questions of the Centre dated 08.04.2013.
As a follow up to this fact, on 15 March 2013, 2 state jobs were created at the MLSAF SR.
A letter was sent to three central state administration bodies by the MLSAF SR with a request for appointment of a contact person as their appointment was not recorded at that time by the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family until 08.04.2013.
The Slovak Republic is obliged to collect the relevant information including statistical and research data to be able to formulate and implement a policy for the implementation of the Convention.
As the MLSAF SR provides, in Slovakia, nowadays there is no system of materially and institutionally coordinated research focused on the issues of disabilities and life of persons with disabilities and their families.
In most cases there are individual research initiatives of various institutions which can be divided into several groups:
The MLSAF SR uses the departmental information system ISOP for the payment of social benefits, which is managed by the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family.
Regular statistics of paid out social benefits including the above stated data is ensured through monthly reports.
With respect to the position of citizens with disabilities on the labour market, in its analyses the MLSAF SR uses data from the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, selective data mining of workforce (VZPS) and corporate data mining, which are available at the website of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic24 (The results of selective data mining of workforce for particular quarters of 2012; specified quarterly publications contain data about the number of workforce with disabilities by gender (tab.

With respect to the operation of a private security service, however, it is necessary to add that probably not all male and female employees generally directly perform the security service, but the private security service has also administrative staff (the secretary's office, assistant positions, etc.) or the management where it is possible to create conditions for an employment of persons with disabilities.
In the area of an optimum position of this group, attention is directed to the creation of appropriate labour conditions.
33 Statement of the Ministry of Finance regarding the questions of the Centre dated 18.02.2013.
Procedural mechanisms in the system of the protection of human rights guarantee equal and efficient protection against all forms of discrimination to persons with disabilities.
Equally, we wished to know how specifically the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was carried out on the level of particular ministries in 2012.
According to a statement of the MH SR, certain provisions of the Convention are implemented in applicable legal regulations falling within the competence of the MH SR.
Pursuant to Article 38
34 Statement of the Ministry of Transport, Construction and Regional Development regarding the questions of the Centre dated 18.02.2013.
To accomplish this target, the MC SR has a subsidy programme Culture of Disadvantaged Population Groups in place, which focuses in particular on the support of availability of culture for vulnerable groups, and also on the promotion of equal opportunities and the prevention of discrimination.
Entities providing the development of cultural needs of handicapped groups (persons with disabilities, elderly persons, vulnerable groups of children and young people, the homeless, migrants, marginalized Roma communities, women, etc.) may apply for grants within the subsidy programme.
The purpose of the programme is also to create conditions for the visualization and presentation of a specific culture of handicapped population groups.
Today the subsidy programme Culture of Disadvantaged Population Groups is an established and stable financial instrument of the MC SR, which allows the satisfaction of cultural needs of people with disabilities.
was allocated for 118 events for vulnerable groups (live culture - festivals, creative art workshops, conferences, etc., written culture - magazines and books).
The Slovak Library for the Blind in Levoča, an organization in the establishing scope of the MC SR plays an exceptional role in this area, whose main sphere of business is to promote the culture of the blind, and whose activities in this area have an immense importance.
of guardianship.
The legislation is ensured so as persons with a certain disability are informed sufficiently, through information on food packages which are suitable for their diet.
Within the area of equal treatment and protection against discrimination, the task of the Ministry of Agriculture is mainly in the area of employment and trading conditions.
The promotion of fundamental rights, non-discrimination and equality of opportunities is a horizontal priority enshrined in the National Strategic Reference Framework for the period of 2007-2013.
The equality of opportunities and related protection of human rights is applied (as a horizontal priority) within all programmes within the Ministry's competences.
in the trans-European conventional and high-speed rail system (TSI PRM), which are virtually identical with obligations resulting from the Convention, as regards the technical aspect.
The scope of adopted measures within TSI PRM applies in particular to a whole circle of persons with reduced mobility and orientation (e.g., including elderly persons, mothers with baby carriages and little kids, etc.).
Within all projects for the renovation and construction of railway infrastructure and rail vehicles, obligations resulting from TSI PRM and EC and SR legislation regulating the relevant issues, are implemented.
The renovation of railway infrastructure is almost exclusively financed from EU funds, and thus within each project, horizontal priorities (Equal Opportunities) are evaluated and subsequently monitored in the selection and approval processes.
Rights of Persons with Disabilities
The content of these may be documents prepared for the blind (Braille script) or pressed relief Latin (Klein script), blocks with Braille labels, audio recordings on electromagnetic and optical media, special papers for the blind, but only if they are posted by an institution for the blind, or if they addressed to such an institution.
• Article 9 (Accessibility) - One of types of the renovation of apartment houses for which it is possible to provide advantageous loans from funds of the State Housing Development Fund is understood as a building conversion of the common areas of apartment houses and common facilities of apartment houses, which will allow an access to apartments in the apartment houses for all persons with reduced mobility.
• Article 28 (Adequate standard of living and social protection) - If a member of applicant's household is a natural person with severe disability who has lived with them in the common household for at least 1 year, it will be possible to extend a loan to such an applicant - natural person on more advantageous conditions (e.g., a higher share of the loan of the procurement price, lower interest and longer maturity period).
In 2012, the MTCRD SR dealt with the rights of persons with disabilities also in the area of tourism, the result of which is a material in authorization process - A Tourism Strategy up to 2020.
because today several statistical data and information for particular spheres of action being the object of reporting, are not available.
In attempting to find out and provide the public with direct contacts to persons being in charge of the coordination of departmental implementation processes we wished to know if during 2012 a contact point for the implementation of the Convention was established on the level of particular Ministries.
It results from the answer of the Ministry that with respect to the appointment of the MLSAF SR as the main contact point, on 15 March 2013, 2 state working positions were created in the Ministry.
The MH SR nominated Mgr. Martina Matejková from the Healthcare Unit of the Health Section of the MH SR as the contact person for the Ministry of Health, who will submit reports on legislative changes to the MLSAF SR and on changes in the area of rights of persons with disabilities (until 30 June 2013 and then annually until 30 June).
On the level of Regional Education System Section the relevant task is performed by a Unit that is materially competent for the issue of education, upbringing and advisory for children and pupils with disabilities.
In other specialized units the issues of persons with disabilities are dealt with as cross-sectional within other spheres of activity.
In the Ministry of Culture (MC SR), the contact point for the implementation of the Convention was the Cultural Heritage Section - the Unit of Intangible Cultural Heritage and Handicapped Population Groups (Mgr. Daniela Kuhnová).
On the grounds of the ME SR, according to their words, there has been no reason yet to establish a contact point for the implementation of Convention.
Similarly, within the MTCRD SR, in 2012, no contact point has been established for the implementation of the Convention, and its establishment is not planned.
Furthermore, the Centre asked what specific steps and measures resulting from Articles 5 - 30 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities were the subject of legislative process in 2012.
According to the words of the MLSAF SR, this amendment was ready with an attempt of dealing with persistent problems and the crisis situation in the financing of social services (including social services for persons with disabilities) and eliminating the risk of the collapse of existing care-taking institutions, which would endanger the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the recipients of social services.
The subject of the amendment of Act on Social Services
Such regulations comply with Art. 15, 16 and 17 (Freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse, Protecting the integrity of the person).
On 30 November 2011, the Slovak Government adopted A Strategy on Deinstitutionalization of the Social Services System and Foster Care in the Slovak Republic, which presents official acceptance of the transition from institutional to community-based care.
The key focus of deinstitutionalization in the Slovak Republic is, according to the MLSAF SR, the creation and provision of conditions for independent and free life of all citizens who are
dependent on the assistance of society, in a natural social environment of a community, through a complex of quality alternative services in the public interest.
On 14 December 2011, the MLSAF SR adopted a "National Action Plan on the Transition from Institutional to Communitybased care in the System of Social Services for 2011 - 2015", which according to the Ministry presents the basic planning and performance document in the field of transformation and deinstitutionalization of the system of social services and foster care.
As the MLSAF SR informed us further, over the course of 2012, an application for a non-refundable financial allowance was processed for the National Project on Transformation and Deinstitutionalization of Social Services, which was adopted on 23 January 2013.
The National Project will be supported within the Operational Programme Employment and Social Inclusion in an amount of 1,000,000 EUR.
Its task is to monitor, evaluate and coordinate deinstitutionalization processes and propose measures for an increase in the support and efficiency of deinstitutionalization processes.
The MLSAF SR also wishes to prepare an extensive amendment to the Act on Social Services, and within it deal with the issue of creating conditions of a new long-term care system (in particular for elderly clients and persons with disabilities who are dependent on the help of another person).
However, according to the words of the MLSAF SR, the system depends on the introduction of a new financing mechanism for social services, so as to strengthen the client's right to social service and its availability, and also the financial sustainability of the system would be ensured.
Nowadays the MLSAF SR plans multi-source financing of such services as social services were decentralized and are financed exclusively from the budgets of self-governments (the municipality, regional self-government units), whose budgetary resources are allegedly insufficient, also as a result of the economic and financial crisis.
Therefore the Ministry suggests that social services on both the local and regional level should be financed also by the state which should be the sponsor of client's right to social service, which is already declared by the law.
In 2012, the Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR established a working group for amendment of Act on Social Services whose members are all actors working in this area (the representatives of local and regional self-governments, the representatives of social service providers, the representatives of recipients of social services, including persons with disabilities, experts in this field).
The amendment to Act on Social Services should become effective on 01.01.2014, and the Ministry of Labour expects from it:
• More stringent and supplemented conditions for the registration of providers;
• Detailed regulations for the quality of conditions (standards) of social services;
• Integration of the requirement of transformation of residential social services for alternative community social services in order to create conditions for the client to stay as long as possible in the natural home and community environment.

The amendment should have a positive contribution to the prevention and performance of efficient action against any abuse, neglect and ill-treatment of persons being minor or incompetent, or whose legal capacity is limited (in particular persons with disabilities belonging to the above stated circle of persons).

Plus, with respect to resident traffic the Act in Article 18 imposes the creation of offer of an adequate scope of transport services in domestic transport ensuring regular transport on the territory of a region or municipality.
Vulnerable traffic participants means a foot passenger, cyclist, motorcyclist and a person with disabilities or a person with reduced mobility or orientation ability.
In the legislative process is a draft bill on the State Housing Development Fund, which deals with the issue of higher quality for housing and ensuring available housing for persons with severe disabilities.
draft is submitted for negotiations of the Slovak National Council, and if it is adopted, it will become effective on 1 January 2014.
We also demanded from particular central state administration bodies the preparation of the status of elimination of barriers in access to public institutions, in comparison with the previous year.
We also wished to find out how many new barrier-free entries were developed in particular Ministries in 2012, and also whether they reported any motions or complaints by the public with respect to elimination of such barriers.
In 2012, in compliance with Act No. 544/2010 Coll. on Subsidies in the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic, subsidies were granted from the budget of the chapter of the MLSAF SR to address barrier-free movement in care-taking institutions and to support the mobility of persons with severe disabilities who are dependent on individual transport (special motor vehicles) in an amount of roughly 899 000 EUR.
The MC SR claims that budget and allowance organizations create, according to laws in force and their basis mission, conditions for higher availability of culture for persons with disabilities and keep the elimination of both physical and mental barriers in view (the new building of the Slovak National Theatre, the Slovak Philharmonic, the University Library, etc.).
Eliminating of barriers is supported also through
In 2012, also an informal departmental initiative was implemented for an increase in the availability of culture for hearing impaired persons (meetings with the Association of organizations of Hearing Impaired).
In 2013, the project will involve 4 departmental institutions: the Slovak National Gallery, the Slovak National Museum, and the Museum of the Slovak National Uprising and the Slovak Technical Museum.
Also statistical research in the field of culture contributes to obtaining information on the elimination of barriers (both information-related and physical) - the field of culture of disadvantaged population groups.
Statistics are organized on a yearly basis and published on the mC SR's website.
Starting from 2013, for this purpose a new questionnaire will be implemented, which corresponds to current needs according to the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
The Ministry of Justice does not have the monitoring of the elimination of barriers on entry into public institutions in their powers.
In 2012, the Ministry did not register any motion or complaint from the public related to barrier-free access.
The MI SR, within investment construction does not specifically monitor the category of structures providing the construction of barrier-free entries.
The development of barrier-free entries for persons with disabilities and elderly persons with limited mobility within the facilities of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic is designed as part of the reconstruction of facilities.
The inclusion of particular structures in a plan of investment construction is governed by the order of importance set by relevant budget organizations and possibilities depending on the scope of allocated financial resources.
The MI SR deals with designing of barrier-free entries from time to time within the schedule of investment construction tasks.
Within MI SR facilities there are mainly barriers precluding from entering the facilities and hallways and using sanitary facilities.
Their elimination is designed as the construction of drive-up ramps, staircase ramps, installation of barrier-free sanitary facilities, and modernization of passenger lifts.
In 2011, an updated list was drawn up of police offices for the development of barrier-free entries.
It included totally 80 facilities with a required financial amount of capital expenditure of 1 436 634.03 EUR, which markedly exceeds the current financial possibilities for their inclusion in the investment construction plan.
With respect to financial possibilities regarding the construction of this type, in 2012, no substantial change occurred.
Over the course of 2012, the MI SR with respect to eliminating these barriers, did not register any motions or complaints.
The ME SR observes that they have a barrier-free access for persons with disabilities to the administrative building at Mierová ul.
Street No. 19, Bratislava.
The Ministry does not register any motions or complaints from associations of persons with disabilities related to barrier-free access or other issues.
However, visually impaired citizens have not asked the ME SR for such information yet.
No complaint or motion related to the discrimination of persons with disabilities has been recorded by the MF SR or particular organizations of the Ministry.
They endeavour to eliminate barriers and obstacles preventing availability, to the maximum possible extent, which are focused on buildings and electronic services.
Financial Control bodies pay attention to that persons with disabilities have a barrier-free entrance into buildings or facilities of Financial Control bodies.
Barrier-free access is available for 95 buildings of Financial Control bodies.
In addition to a physical access, for all persons including the ones with disabilities, an employee is available who is ready to help the citizen with disabilities.
In 2012, in order to provide a barrier-free access to public institutions, the MARD SR performed the reconstruction of a lift in the administrative building at Dopravná 14, Levice.
In December 2012, they started the reconstruction of lifts in the administrative building at ul.
Sama Chalúpku 18, Michalovce.
The reconstructions are already completed and the lifts are in operation.
The handover took place on 28 January 2013.
In 2011, one lift was reconstructed in Rimavská Sobota.
(1 piece), Košice (2 pieces), Žilina (2 pieces), Trnava (2 pieces), Piešťany (l piece), Poprad Tatry (2 pieces), Devínska Nová Ves (1 piece), Bratislava Nové Mesto (1 piece), Bratislava Petržalka (1 piece), Humenné (1 piece), Nové Mesto nad Váhom (1 piece), Banská Bystrica (1 piece), Prievidza (1 piece), Vrútky (1 piece), Galanta (1 piece), Podhájska (1 piece) and Levice (1 piece).
The purpose of the building conversion is the creation of conditions for the "Project of providing an access of persons with limited mobility to passenger railway transport services" - supply of goods "Raising platforms for immobile passengers to lift immobile passengers from the railway station platform into the railway wagon".
In all of the above railway stations, local investigation had been performed, following which necessary building conversion was identified, and then investment specifications were prepared, which will serve as a source for the development of project documentation.
Within necessary building conversion, the construction of access roads is required for immobile passengers, of ramps, rail crossings, areas for the location of raising platforms and WC for persons with limited mobility.
The completion of the said "Project" is planned on 31.10.2015.
Within the project, advanced railway rail units are procured (32 units), which have the following components:
a) ramp for the entry of passengers with reduced mobility;
b) system signalling the handling of the ramp to the driver (a safeguard element preventing the closing of the door when an immobile passenger is getting on);
c) labels in Braille script;
d) acoustic and optical information system, security-camera system;
e) seats for the handicapped marked with a pictograph, button to call in help;
f) WC for the handicapped.
Railway infrastructure projects - their implementation plans the installation of elements providing smooth transport of persons with disabilities according to the Commission Decision concerning the technical specification of interoperability relating to "persons with reduced mobility" in the trans-European conventional and high-speed rail system (2008/164/EC).
Within Železnice Slovenskej republiky, entries were developed and gradually completed for immobile passengers in newly reconstructed railway divisions, namely the following:
a) Modernization of route Žilina Krásno nad Kysucou;
b) Modernization of railway route Nové Mesto nad Váhom - Púchov, division: Nové Mesto nad Váhom
c) Modernization of railway route Nové Mesto nad Váhom - Púchov, division: Zlatovce - Trenčianska Teplá;
d) Modernization of railway route Nové Mesto nad Váhom - Púchov, division: Trenčianska Teplá - Beluša;
h) Modernization of route Žilina Košice, division Kysak - Košice;
Slovenská pošta, a. s., according to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities develops barrier-free entries for persons with limited mobility and orientation, in new post-offices, according to the Decree of the Ministry of Environment of the SR No. 532/2002 Coll., which stipulates the details of general technical requirements for the
construction of, and general technical requirements for buildings used by, people with reduced mobility and orientation (Article 57).
SP, a. s., in leased and own facilities where barrier-free entries had not been built gradually develops such entries, and in the future will develop them within its planned reconstruction and modernization of post-offices.
The technical regulation became effective on 10 November 2011 and is still in force.
It stipulates requirements for proposals of debarrierization measures for persons with reduced mobility and orientation on roads.
In addition to the given questions we offered an opportunity to contacted entities to comment on other aspects of the issue of the rights of persons with disabilities.
The purpose of this initiative is to enhance awareness of the majority (workers in the field of culture) of the cultural rights of persons with disabilities, and in the long run, eliminate barriers in culture for vulnerable groups.
The MC SR in cooperation with other entities prepared an analysis of the subsidy programme for 2007 - 2008.
group is also a guide (manual) for the organization of cultural events for persons with disabilities (for organizations within the establishing scope of the Ministry of Culture of the SR).
The material was distributed to organizations within the establishing scope of the MC SR and is available at the MC SR's website.

and the Union of Towns and Cities of Slovakia (hereinafter: the "UTCS") provided us with their answers.
Equally, relevant information was sent to us by the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, the Social Insurance Agency, and the Institute for Labour and Family Research.
They claim that thanks to continuous reminding of this task from the beginning of 2012 by the Slovak Disability Council in the SR (SDC in the SR), whose member and one of the founders is also the AHPMD in the SR, there has been a break-up.
The result of efforts was that the Government Council for Human Rights, Minorities and Gender Equality, on its session on 14.12.2012 expressed consent to the establishment of a contact point, which will be the MLSAF SR.
However, the Government Council is only an advisory body of the Slovak Government.
The AOHD answered to the question regarding the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, including the Optional Protocol that as early as in January 2012 they had prepared problematic issues that with respect to the requirement for the implementation of the document, urgently required legislative measures.
In 2012, however, practically no significant developments occurred in dealing with them.
standing expert body.
"The support of activities of representative non-governmental organizations of persons with disabilities and communication with public authorities is insufficient.
Equally, on the basis of these facts nGo's membership in international organizations is jeopardized."
The UTCS provided a couple of examples of imperfections in the current legislative conditions of the.
According to UTCS, not only old buildings, but also new public buildings do not have a barrier-free access, and do not comply with legislative requirements.
However, in most cases, after the final building approval, no consequences were drawn.
According to the SBPSU, only in the second half-year of 2012, the MLSAF SR started to prepare relevant proposals for measures for the Government.
The Social Insurance Agency38 also
38 Statement of the Social Insurance Agency regarding the questions of the Centre dated 15.02.2013.
39 To obtain more details, we recommend contacting the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family in the relevant matter.
In its answer with respect to questions related to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family40 states that in November 2012, a material of the COLSAF was submitted for amendment procedure to the MLSAF SR - Proposal for the establishment of main contact point for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities - on which the Central Office has not provided any comments.
In your opinion, how civic society is involved in the plans of establishing contact points for the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and in the coordination mechanism as such, and in particular persons with disabilities and their representative organizations?
The UTCS and the AOHD critically claim that conditions for the participation of civic society are not created at all, in particular of the representative organizations of persons with disabilities, in the monitoring, but on the contrary, due to insufficient financial support for the activities of national umbrella organizations of persons with disabilities the organizations are forced to reduce their activity and they are in danger of disappearing.
states that organizations of persons with disabilities are joining the process mainly on their own initiative in particular through advisory bodies such as the Disability Committee of the Slovak Government Council for Human Rights, Minorities and Gender Equality.
In the opinion of the AHPMD, the ratification of the Convention has not speeded up the legislative process yet.
The AHPMD as an organization is not a compulsory person in the amendment procedure.
They received the new legislation through the Slovak Disability Council or from the monitoring of the Portal on legal regulations.
Not only present health care facilities, schools and educational institutions, public buildings, transportation facilities and domestic houses a barrier from the past, but often new and reconstructed buildings and public areas do not comply with legislative requirements for barrier-free construction.
On the takeover of buildings (final building approval), if the relevant legislation is not complied with, no reasonable consequences are drawn (sanctions are missing).
Thus the motivation of local self-governments decreases.
The laws should be amended as soon as possible, in compliance with Convention requirements.
As an executive body acting in the area of social insurance, however, they prefer commenting on draft legal regulations which directly relate to the Social Insurance Agency's activities, in particular in the context of applicability of adopted legal regulations by Social Insurance Agency's organizational units.
Were your comments taken into account?
Equally, amendment to Act No. 5/2004 Coll. on Employment is in a legislative process, where comments were partially accepted.
Comments are partially accepted.
They participated for instance in the following interdepartmental amendment procedures:
Chapter 1.
Rights of Persons with Disabilities
• For a draft bill on personal data protection and on amending and supplementing certain laws;
The SBPSU is not able to express their view mainly due to a lack of motions by persons with disabilities.
However, they believe that the legislation is rather good.
According to the AOHD, we can expect that if the current discrimination legislation changes, new all-society measures might have a positive effect also as regards the economic aspect because it is known that thanks to efficient habilitation and rehabilitation, as well as thanks to compensations, a persons with disabilities who is correctly integrated in society and work becomes the payer of both direct and indirect taxes and transfer payments, and the family is reasonably unburdened and can also attend to work and social activities.
However, the AOHD claims that the social legislation places citizens with disabilities into a position of the recipient of assistance, they are not allowed to move further and become independent on social assistance.
The setting of the whole assistance system is that citizens with disabilities are not able to, or are able to, but only with big problems or with strong economic family support, reach economic independence.
Specific cases:
• Cash benefits for the compensation of severe disability, in Act No 447/2008 Coll. are not legally enforceable (they can be granted!), which allows clientelism (or even corruption?) in their awarding.
The assessment system is inconsistent, obsolete, decisions on the granting of benefits depends on subjective assessment of particular advisory boards.
technologies, mobility devices, equipment and supportive technologies, which are suitable for persons with different disabilities.
It means that if a citizen becomes dependant on the help of another, e.g. at the age of 67, they are not entitled to the benefit for personal assistant, but only to home care service even though they wish to be active, both socially and at work (artists, politicians, entrepreneurs, teachers and other professions).
Chapter 1.
benefit for a purchase of a motor vehicle can only be granted before 65 years of age.
As an alternative, it allows granting a cash allowance for transport, e.g. by taxi service.
This, however, markedly limits personal mobility.
An own motor vehicle, especially if a person with disability is able to drive it independently, allows the transport at any time, anywhere and as often as they need.
Demographic indicators show that even the number of citizens with disabilities, in particular in business, politics, art professions, crafts, etc., who wish to be active also in their seniority, increases, and the solution to their everyday needs in the form of allowance for transport or home care service is not adequate, and even is not economically beneficial.
Passive receipt of allowances means expenses from public funds, while economically active persons automatically become the payers of direct and indirect taxes, to a larger extent they are the consumers of goods and services, and thus not only they refund the allowances, but they also bring income into the State Treasury.
The AOHD provided examples of economic benefit of the support of activates of persons with disabilities, which were prepared by MUDr.
Mária Orgonášová, the Honorary President of AOHD:
If the same person is employed and earns e.g. 300 EUR per month, he/she would pay transfer payments of roughly 60 eUr per month; for 7 years it would be roughly 5040 EUR.
It results from the above calculations that for 7 years he/she could return a total of ca. 11 468 EUR to the State Treasury, which is more by 2 206 EUR than he/ she would get from allowances.
state the awareness of the providers of banking services of the obligation to meet general technical requirements in providing their services (e.g., the location of ATMs).
According to the Social Insurance Agency, as at 31 December 2012, with respect to persons with disabilities, there were no legislative changes of Act on Social Insurance, which could be considered as discriminatory.
With respect to an unfavourable health condition, invalidity pensions are provided from Pension Insurance; and also the provision of invalidity pensions "from the youth" has been kept for natural persons who became disabled in a period when they were dependent children.
Invalidity pensions are provided to these persons without the fulfilment of Pension Insurance condition.
In addition to a material on a proposal for the establishment of the main contact point for the implementation of the Convention, the Social Insurance Agency also dealt with the National Social Report 2012 and the Initial Report of the Slovak Republic on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which were submitted for interdepartmental amendment procedure; the Social Insurance Agency, taking into account its material competence, did not apply any comments on the said materials.
How do you assess the elimination of barriers in access to public institutions in comparison with the previous year?
What types of barriers do you encounter?
In 2012, was there any fundamental change in eliminating them in comparison with the previous year?
If you have such data, how many barrier-free entries were developed in 2012?
Do you record any motions or complaints from the public with respect to elimination of such barriers?
The SBPSU confirmed that they did not keep statistics of this type.
However, they think that there has been a slight improvement in new structures and reconstructions in particular thanks to inviting the SBPSU for consultations of projects and final building approvals.
the process is very slow and their capacities are insufficient, often agreed measures are not respected.
Projects financed from EU funds exist, which even do not respect the rules of accessibility formulated also in national legislation in force (Decree 532/2002 Coll.).
The AHPMD SR answered that they did not notice enhanced elimination of such barriers.
However, they experienced a situation when a citizens' association had installed a platform elevator, into a public building where they leased premises for their activity, at their own expenses.
As to a barrier-free access, of a total number of 36 branches of the Social Insurance Agency, as at 31 December 2012, they have a barrier-free access in 36 branches, i.e. 100% of branches have conditions for access of persons with a handicap.
in 2013 the Insurance Agency plans a designing stage of the reconstruction of the other building, part of which will be the development of barrier-free access.
In addition to branches, Social Insurance Agency conducts its activities also through detached offices of the relevant branches.
They are the following offices: Brezno (Banská Bystrica branch), Ružomberok (Liptovský Mikuláš branch), Kežmarok (Poprad branch), Púchov and Dubnica nad Váhom (Považská Bystrica branch), Bytča (Žilina branch).
The branch in Ružomberok has an access to the building without building obstacle for disabled clients.
The Social Insurance Agency endeavours to develop barrier-free entries also into these facilities.
With respect to persons with sensory handicap, the Social Insurance Agency has an internal regulation in place for the procedure of employees in providing blind or weak-sighted or deaf or hearing-impaired persons with information.
In 2012, the Insurance Agency did not register any complaints of barriers, either physical or in communication with persons with disabilities, from persons with disabilities, including in providing information, whether personally or in writing.
The other organizations have not expressed their opinion with respect to this question.
Can you assess based on your experience the conditions of asserting persons with disabilities in Slovak society, in 2012?
What proposals would you offer for their better assertion in 2012 - to whom and with what result?
The SBPSU does not notice any marked improvement in the previous year.
conditions the legislative environment for the observance of the rights of persons with disabilities is favourable.
In 2012, the ILFR performed together with the MLSAF SR its obligation to promote research focused on the living conditions of persons with disabilities and their families defined in Rule 13 of the valid "National Programme for the Development of Living Conditions for Citizens with Disabilities in All Areas of Life".
Within a contract with ILFR, they allocated financial resources for the implementation of a research project focused on protected work of persons with disabilities as a foundation for the preparation of changes in the system of active labour market measures.
As early as in 2010, the AHPMD SR filed a proposal of guardianship reform to the Ministry of Justice of the SR, and then asked the new management of Ministry several times in writing when they would be incorporated.
In 2012, the organization was informed in writing that the incorporation of proposals was planned within the recodification of the Civil Code, and also that they planned communication with AHPMD in the SR when the paragraph text is ready, and that they did not know the term at that time.
ÚS 313/2012-52 of 28.01.2012, his right to private and family life had been violated, and his right to due process and right to equal justice under the law41.
For the violation of these rights, the Regional Court in Bratislava must pay to the plaintiff a compensation of 3 000 EUR.
It is the first judgment of the Constitutional Court which relates to the problematic issue of deprivation of mentally handicapped persons of legal capacity.
The Constitutional Court stressed that today disabilities, as well as rights of people with disabilities are perceived by the expert public in a different manner than in the past.
In this context it is necessary to understand also the infringement of legal capacity.
In the relevant judgment, the Constitutional Court marked deprivation of legal capacity as "legal death".
The Court emphasized that if ordinary courts decide on ones capacity, they have to proceed to deprivation only in extreme cases, because it is the last resort (ultima ratio).
Courts have to consider whether less restrictive measures are sufficient to protect a person with disabilities concerned, such as the limitation upon legal capacity.
In addition, the Constitutional Court dealt with the issue of expert opinions in proceedings on legal capacity.
They stated that court should not non-critically accept expert's opinions and mechanically take over their outcomes; but should build mainly on an examination of the person concerned, and develop other evidence leading to the assessment of diverse social and legal relations.
A mere conclusion that a man suffers from a mental disorder which is not temporary, is not sufficient for the deprivation of legal capacity.
Plus, in June, the AHPMD SR launched a Campaign I DO NOT WANT BUT I HAVE TO (NECHCEM, ALE MUSÍM)... more details at: www.nechcemalemusim.sk.
With respect to the campaign we have carried out lots of activities.
The campaign continues in 2013, too.
Just like every year, on 12 June, a nationwide Day of Deformed Mirrors (DEŇ KRIVÝCH ZRKADIEL) is organized - an event focused on the elimination of biases, stereotypes and change of attitudes to people with disabilities.
The AHPMD SR contacted the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR several times with a request for system solution in the field of lifelong education for people with mental disorders.
They received a written answer in which the Ministry assured that they welcomed all proposals and suggestions which will help perform the strategy of lifelong education 2011.
The SFEY is ready to deal with the concept of supporting the involvement of disabled persons in education, in terms of material competences in the system of follow-up education (July 2012).
No specific measures were taken in 2012.
Plus, in May, the AHPMD SR sent a proposal of measures to the Ministry of Interior of the SR for the preparation of amendment of election laws; the written answer says that with respect to the Programme of the Slovak Government focused on the election issues our comments are included in the database of comments, proposals and initiatives related to the application of election law.
We are not aware of other specific steps in this area.
If the disabled person is not present on the vehicle, the exemption only applies to the vehicle, if it is on a return journey after transport of disabled person to a health care or similar facility.
A cash benefit for increased expenses relating to the operation of motor vehicle is defined by Act 447/2008 Coll. on Cash Benefits for Compensation of Severe Disability and on amending and supplementing of certain laws: For the purposes of this Act, increased expenses relating to the operation of passenger motor vehicle shall be understood as expenses for fuels that serve for its operation, which the natural person with severe disability uses for labour activities, educational activities, family or civil activities.
The condition of the use of a passenger motor vehicle for labour activities is met if a natural person with severe disability runs a business, operates or carries out self-employment at the place of his/ her permanent residence.
If a citizen uses the compensation for labour, educational, family and civil activities, why does the opinion define a different purpose, which is markedly narrowed (hospitalization or transport into a medical institution or transport of a citizen with severe disability into a care-taking institution)?
The compensation serves for their social integration.
Thus they joined an initiative of many clients of care-taking
The activity was successful.
Other activities initiated by the AHPMD SR continued from the previous periods.
They include in particular the deinstitutionalization of social services in the SR.
Deinstitutionalization is one of key instruments for the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and also of gradual social inclusion of all citizens in society.
The MLSAF SR approved the National Action Plan on the Transition from Institutional to Community-based care in the System of Social Services for 2012 - 2015, which contains specific steps for the launch of deinstitutionalization in the SR, through the National Project on the Support of Deinstitutionalization and Transformation of the System of Social Services (NP DI), from the resources of the European Social Fund and other investment funds within the Regional Operational Programme.
On 7 March 2012, a Deinstitutionalization Expert Committee was established at the MLSAF SR, which is an advisory body of the Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic.
The Deinstitutionalization Expert Committee has an interdepartmental character and a representation of all key partners in the system of social services and foster care, including representatives of national organizations of persons with disabilities and seniors, and also a representative of the European Expert Group on Deinstitutionalization (EEG).
The main task of the Expert Committee is to monitor, evaluate and coordinate deinstitutionalization processes in the system of social services and foster care, and to propose changes and measures for the support of deinstitutionalization.
In 2012, the Committee met only once (June 2012).
The Slovak Disability Council has one representative in the Committee.
How was in 2012 cooperation between non-governmental organizations representing the interests of persons with disabilities (good, neutral, bad level)?
If it was bad, what measures should be taken and where?
They are a member of the Slovak Disability Council, Slovak Humane Council, Slovak Anti-Poverty Network, Socioforum.
They are also a member of Inclusion Europe and Inclusion International.
Through the Slovak Disability Council they have a representative in the Government Council for NGOs, in the Government Council for Human Rights, Minorities and Gender Equality, in the working group for the preparation of amendment of Act on Social Services, in the Deinstitutionalization Expert Committee mentioned above; they have a member in the Committee for Research and Education in the field of Human Rights and Development Education (nominated for the Disability Committee).
They cooperate with organizations of persons with disabilities and also with those representing them.
They join activities of various NGOs, which enhance the development of civic society.
The SBPSU cooperates in particular in the form of consultations and preparation of joint proposals.
Its level is, however, uneven and often low.
The main reason is insufficient capacity of the Slovak Disability Council and of organizations of persons with disabilities and their insufficient support by the state to maintain the minimum professional capacity required for systematic advocacy and promotion of rights of persons and solve tasks related to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular to Article 33.3.
The UTCS claims that towns intensely communicate with organizations of persons disabilities (OPD) unless such organizations operate on the level of towns, they create other platforms for the communication of problems that these persons with disabilities encounter, they try to solve them, and within the scope of their possibilities they also provide individual support, including financial.
The Institute for Labour and Family Research represents the SR within the pan-European academic network ANED (Academic Network of European Disability experts; www.disability-europe.net), monitors public policies in the field of social inclusion, education,
employment, support of independent life or availability on a regular basis.
The AHPMD SR cooperates with some MPs, but due to a lack of finances their capacities are limited and the cooperation cannot be as intense as they would like to have and wish to have.
In the answer the SBPSU claims that cooperation consist in particular in submitting draft comments to MPs on legislative proposals discussed in the Parliament.
Also certain parliamentary proposals are consulted in advance.
They have a relatively good cooperation with the MPs of the European Parliament whom they contact along with partnership organizations from EU countries and through international organizations such as the EDF and EBU with applications for the support of proposals and proposed amendments discussed in the eP.
To what other things would you like to call attention with respect to the rights of persons with disabilities in the Slovak Republic in 2012?
Again, the AHPMD calls attention to the already mentioned break-through judgment of the Constitutional Court, which relates to the problematic area of deprivation of persons with disabilities of legal capacity.
In the relevant judgment, the Constitutional Court marked deprivation of legal capacity as "legal death" and emphasized that if ordinary courts decide on ones capacity, they have to proceed to deprivation only in extreme cases, because it is the last resort (ultima ratio).
Conclusion
The Centre deals with this specialized issue separately in an extensive Report on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the Slovak Republic.
The Centre appreciates the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol by the Slovak Republic.
The Centre perceives this act as an assumption of liability under which also Slovakia is obliged to protect the rights of persons with disabilities fully and completely.
Equally, in the context of the application of provisions of the Convention to everyday life from the level of self-governments, the Centre appreciates the comprehensive and professional nature and scope of activities and processes which are carried out by villages, towns or self-government units for the benefit of persons with disabilities, and also their real interest in dealing with this issue.
Destabilization, a lack of finances, non-uniformity of opinions result in turning down of the most important voice of PD and a loss of attention to their requirements.
The Centre will further intensely take interest in the implementation process of the Convention, and in this respect they will propose solutions on their own initiative.
In conclusion it is necessary to point to the fact that the recipients of social services are citizens whose health condition permanently worsens, they require demanding social and other care.
Also care-taking institutions accept citizens with constantly more serious health conditions, limited movement and orientation.
However, self-governments have only limited financial resources for debarrierization, which is inevitable for quality social care for persons with disabilities.
The labour market has an acute and continued lack of job opportunities for persons with disabilities, the support of their employment is insufficient and demanding in terms of administration.
Contributions and benefits do not solve disadvantaged conditions and barriers that these people encounter.
Solutions are only partial, not systematic and sustainable.
The access of persons with disabilities to healthcare is insufficient; in many cases even discriminatory.
Generally mentally handicapped persons or persons with mental disorders are not provided with sufficient healthcare.
Problems persist in providing healthcare to persons with disabilities - lack of dental centres for disabled persons, lack of specialized facilities for persons with severe disabilities, where also the healthcare would be provided for clients with severe mental diagnoses.
Physicians often refuse to visit these persons in care-taking institutions, or they are provided with healthcare in a manner which does not take into account their disability.
For instance, dental care is often refused for persons with mental disabilities, if such persons do not cooperate sufficiently with the attending physician, or an employee accompanying such persons for examination does not ensure the cooperation.
People encounter such an unequal approach in the provision of healthcare also on grounds of their age (seniors) as the care of such citizens is not attractive and "effective" for healthcare providers.
The access to healthcare is insufficient also with respect to persons who are deprived of legal capacity.
The current legislation does not allow healthcare providers to provide such persons with the healthcare without a prior written consent of their legal representatives or guardians, which extends the time of healthcare unnecessarily.
Recommendations
• Establish or implement, on the national level, a system containing one or more independent systems, for the enforcement, protection and monitoring of the performance of Convention.
In establishing or implementing these mechanisms we recommend considering principles relating to the position and activities of national institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights.
• Actively involve civic entities in the process of monitoring of the performance and implementation of the Convention (according to Article 33 par. 3), and in this process strictly apply the principle "Nothing about persons with
• Ensure the state support to representative organizations of persons with disabilities which will allow them to build, maintain and develop required capacities.
• The need of "covering-in" of all citizens with disabilities, and of stopping the shattering of forces and financial resources into particular citizens' associations of persons with disabilities.
Many persons with disabilities are not able to orientate themselves in new laws and regulations and are not aware of possibilities of where and what information or assistance they can get.
• With respect to the legislation in force - the current legal status is not sufficient as a law on social and legal protection of persons with severe disabilities is absent.
The adoption of such law could clearly define obligations of all entities involved, as well as forms of assistance and protection of persons with severe disabilities.
The absence of such a law has an adverse effect mainly on mentally handicapped citizens who in many cases are not able to seek their rights with respect to their condition.
• It is necessary that the local and regional self-governments pay attention to citizens with disabilities performs its obligations to them, which also requires higher financial resources for available community services for disabled people.
• Within the Slovak Republic it is necessary to increase awareness in the field of social policy, strategy and financing of social services, with a sensitive regard for real recipients of social services in institutional care and in the home environment.
• It is necessary to communicate campaigns through the media, which would eliminate the biases and fear of majority society of
It is necessary to carefully set both legislative and non-legislative mechanisms preventing the discrimination of persons with disabilities where such measures will be for the benefit of handicapped women, children, and seniors.
• Performance of activities that motivate to dealing with the debarrierization of publicly available premises in towns and villages, e.g., by tenders.
• Debarrierization must become • part of a wider inclusive social policy of a town/village, even though the removal of historical sediments of architectural barriers is costly.
• Legal regulations concerning the unification of discounts provided in railway and bus traffic throughout the SR and on the local level.
• With respect to persons who require necessary accommodation or satisfaction of the essentials of life, created conditions and develop a network of social services in lodging-houses, shelters, emergency quarters, half-way houses, • low-threshold daily centres.
• It is necessary to handle persons with disabilities as independent persons and they should be allowed to fully integrate into society and guaranteed an independent way of life.
• Ensure equality of all PD on all levels of life and support respect to their natural dignity.
ÚS 313/2012-52 of 28.01.2012.
Complete cancellation of the concept of deprivation of legal capacity and keeping of a limited capacity could also be considered.
Before the period of possible amendment of relevant legal regulations it is necessary to provide for efficient control of the deprivation of legal capacity to prevent the occurrence of apparently unauthorized and wasted cases (not only in terms of the legislation) of the deprivation of capacity.
Equally, in this context it is necessary to concentrate on activities leading to a shift in approach to mentally handicapped persons in compliance with Article 12 of the Convention - Equal recognition before the law (A shift from substitute decision-making, which is characterized by that a guardian makes decisions on behalf of the person concerned to supported decision-making, which is based on a prerequisite that the person is able to make an independent decision.
For that, however, he/she may need some support.).
For the recipients of social services who are able to live their live independently, support the development of facilities of supported housing.
• The Centre highlights that a disability cannot be a limiting factor in an access to education or healthcare services.
• Intensify systematic and compulsory education for human rights leading to the elimination of discrimination and to enforcement of the principle of equal treatment at elementary, secondary schools and universities.
• In healthcare provision, it is necessary to keep in mind a barrier-free access, availability, removal of qualitative differences in healthcare for persons with disabilities and other persons, prevent and prohibit any discrimination in the area of healthcare, including health and life insurance on grounds of disability.
• In the field of labour and employment, the Centre accents the need of creating measures for an improvement of the condition of persons with disabilities in the labour market.
Systematic education, programmes motivating employers to implement diversity management, legislative measures enhancing the position in the labour market should give a chance to persons with disabilities to live on a freely selected job or a job accepted in the labour market.
• It is necessary to help persons with disabilities in their integration in the labour market (actively prepare an efficient labour market policy and jobs so that they are more barrier-free) with the use of the European Social Fund, and develop effective services for the mediation of their employment.
However, here we must add that in addition to the prohibition of discrimination declared by the law, it is necessary to adopt such measures that will implement an efficient and fast system for control and enforceability of such rights.
M*3t
On the national level, the basic definition of right to education is laid down by Article 42 of the Constitution.
The Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms enshrined three components of the right to education in two sentences, as follows:
• Right in the form of prohibition for the state to infringe upon the exercise of such right by that its infringement would as a matter of fact deny the exercise of such right;
• Right to choose any forms of education and teaching, whereas the State is obliged to safeguard the right in the scope of its possibilities, which means that the State need not safeguard the education of choice for everyone;
Citizens have the right to free education at primary and secondary schools and, based on their abilities and society's resources, also at higher educational establishments.
Schools other than state schools may be established, and instruction in them provided, only under conditions defined by law.
Such schools may charge a tuition fee.
A law will specify under which conditions citizens who are engaged in studies are entitled to assistance from the state.
Everyone's right to education must be interpreted also in the context of the provision of Article 12 par. 2 of the
44 Among the most important acts are, for instance:
- Act No. 568/2009 Coll. on Further Education and on amendments and supplements of certain acts, as
Chapter 2.
Right to Education
amended;
Another rule of law regulating the exercise of right to education is also the Anti-discrimination Act.
In connection with the rights of persons laid down by special acts, it lays everyone under an obligation to respect the principle of equal treatment in education, while to determine whether discrimination has occurred or not, no account shall be taken of whether the underlying reasons were based on facts or on erroneous assumptions (Article 3).
Recommendations of OECD with respect to Education System
In its Report on the current status of Slovak economy for 2012, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (hereinafter referred to as the "OECD") paid special attention to the field of Education System, for which they offer several recommendations.
46 They should contribute to an improvement of results in the education system using a cost-effective method.
The OECD advises to raise teachers' salaries while introducing structural measures that will increase the system affectivity, such as the optimization of the school network, increase in the capacity of classrooms, or introduction of the incentive mponent of teachers' salary.
nia-oecd-vo-vztahu-k-skolstvu/.
The Report identified defects in the use of available evaluations in identifying dysfunctional schools and also schools that can serve as examples of best teaching practices.
School funding should be accommodated to local needs with higher level of autonomy.
The Report also recommends eliminating the benefits for eight years secondary schools and strengthening the integration process for pupils with special educational and schooling needs into the standard system.
According to the OECD, Slovakia should raise the support of disadvantaged pupils from underprivileged environment, including Roma pupils, and encourage the involvement of children from such environment jin^_hepre-schoolieducation^^_
The Report also recommends focusing on the acquisition of professional experience during studies and vocational training through the development of a legal framework for dual system of apprentice education.
According to the above OECD recommendations, it is important for Slovakia to concentrate, inter alia, on socially disadvantaged pupils from underprivileged environment, especially on Roma pupils.
Roma Reform in Education
Education of the Roma belongs among the most significant issues relating to
Chapter 2.
the exercise of the right to education in the Slovak Republic.
Upbringing and education of the members of Roma community and children from socially disadvantaged environment is carried out within the system of schools and school facilities.
The education reform contained the following main proposals:
• The State cannot rely on irresponsible parents that they raise responsible children, and therefore the State will provide for adequate education of the children of irresponsible parents as early as before starting the elementary school;
• An ambition of the State will not be a child with completed school attendance, but a child who can find their place in the labour market.
The purpose of the present education system is that a child completes compulsory school attendance, and not that the child acquires qualifications corresponding to their abilities and is prepared for the labour market.
If we fail to educate a child from the very beginning, we often let the children of irresponsible and incapable parents run in the street up to seven years of their age.
Such a child will usually end in a special classroom or school where the state often pays an amount for education which is twice as high as the amount for a child standard school.
Finally such a child will not obtain any certificate of apprenticeship or job, and will remain dependent on the social system forever.
It is necessary to provide for that children and young people coming from risk families are not dependent on social benefits and are able to find their place in the labour market.
According to a statement of the Office of the Plenipotentiary of 18.02.2013 Right Way - Roma reform in the field
A part of Roma reform focusing on educational process sets forth that the State cannot rely on that irresponsible parents will raise responsible children.
The State will provide for adequate education of the children of irresponsible parents as early as before starting the elementary school.
A planned solution (mentioned in the past) is that resources designated for the attendance of children from socially dependent families (which will be identified as risk on the basis of set criteria) to school will be used to cover costs related to the introducing a daylong educational system of such child.
However, here it will be necessary to set the criteria following which a socially dependent family is identified as risk, which will result in the education of children from such a family within the day-long educational system and the use of benefits for school attendance for its financial coverage, in compliance with the Anti-discrimination Act and ensure that they do not present a discriminatory measure based on grounds of membership in the Roma minority.
Here the threat is that the relevant measure will have segregating consequences and will affect exclusively children from Roma families who will be concentrated in day-long educational facilities, whereby they will be segregated from the majority society.
It appears to the Centre that a suitable solution is to place emphasis on the principle of social dependence, real threat of children education in their home environment, and on the childrens needs in the interest of protection of their rights.
The Roma reform proposes introducing of compulsory 3 years pre-school education for children from risk families who are identified on the basis of a combination of criteria such as the parents education, the parents
In the context of the name "compulsory kindergarten" it is necessary to state that according to the Antidiscrimination Act in case that compulsory kindergarten is designated exclusively for children from bad social conditions without the command of Slovak language and basic hygienic and social habits, this could be considered as indirect discrimination in the field of education on grounds of different position.
Pursuant to the provision of Article 2a par. 3 of the Anti-discrimination Act, indirect discrimination shall not mean provision, decision, instruction or practice objectively justified by a legitimate aim if such provision, decision, instruction or practice is appropriate and necessary for achieving of such aim.
According to Article 2 par. 2 of the said Convention, States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child's parents, legal guardians, or family members.
Pursuant to Art. 12 par. 1 and 2 of
the Constitution, people are free and equal in dignity and their rights.
Basic rights and liberties are inviolable, inalienable, secured by law, and unchallengeable.
Basic rights and liberties on the territory of the Slovak Republic are guaranteed to everyone regardless of sex, race, colour of skin, language, creed and religion, political or other beliefs, national or social origin, affiliation to a nation or ethnic group, property, descent, or another status.
The purpose of the Roma reform is also to stop enrolling pupils with minor mental handicaps - the so-called variant A into special elementary schools.
In this context it is necessary that within children diagnostics a real and objective assessment is made on whether children with minor mental handicaps are really able to attend mainstream schools, and whether it will not excessively burden teachers, in particular with respect to high numbers of pupils in classrooms.
One of proposed measures is an extension of compulsory school attendance up to 12 years of child's age who over the course of 9 years of compulsory school attendance does not complete successfully the eight year of elementary school, enters a compulsory three years vocational school with compulsory two years practice according to pupil's choice and abilities, decisions of parents and needs of the labour market, the aim of which will be to maximize the chance for placing the child into the labour market.
In this case we also take the liberty of stressing the violation of the Antidiscrimination Act as it is not possible to put only a certain group of children under an obligation of compulsory 12 years school attendance.
According to the above it is not possible to limit the selection of education only to certain "types".
Moreover, the Anti-discrimination Act would be violated by that all children would not have an equal opportunity of education as children from the risk environment would be obliged to start a compulsory vocational school according to the proposal.
The Roma reform proposes that the attendance and behaviour of a child in the school environment should directly influence the form and amount of state social support to the family from which the child comes.
The Centre does not consider the said measure a suitable solution, but they consider it rather an impairment of the child's situation, i.e. a truanting child by reducing his/her standard of life, which will have a worse effect on his/her mental and physical development, and it is a clear violation of not only the Act on Family but also of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its main objectives.
The Centre reminds that in Article 31 the Act on Family sanctions inappropriate behaviour of children, as well as the breach of parents' obligations resulting from their parental rights and obligations, or the abuse of their rights, by imposing educational measures or by temporary removal of a minor child from personal care.
Moreover, the Roma reform also plans an extension of assistant teachers from kindergartens and elementary schools to secondary education, cancellation of lunch in elementary schools in the form of uncooked food, by providing holiday operation of kindergartens and elementary schools in order to fully purposefully educate children also during holidays.
The Centre agrees with the said measures and considers them positive and beneficial to children.
The Centre recommends the adoption of several measures.
Some measures can be taken in the near future; the others require further discussions and progressive putting into practice.
In putting into practice, the collaboration of all parties concerned will be required, not only of the Roma.
Such measures will never be sufficient without the cooperation of parents showing interest in the education of their children.
The Centre reminds and stresses the fact that segregation as an unwanted phenomenon cannot be accepted in any form and for any reasons.
In the area of right to education and specifically in the context of the upcoming Roma reform, the Centre recommends the following:
• An appropriate solution seems to be to place emphasis on the principle of social dependence, real threat to child's upbringing in his/ her home environment, and to the needs of the child in the interest of the protection of his/her rights.
• Pay attention to objective psychological diagnostics of children by a state institution.
• Introduce compulsory 12 years school attendance for all children without exception, but without limiting the orientation of further education in the form of vocational courses.
Segregation in Šarišské Michaľany
In the given case the Elementary School in Šarišské Michaľany, which had created separate special classes attended exclusively by students of Roma ethnic membership, was sued.
From the reasoning of the judgment follows that these special classes are even placed on a separate floor inside the building of the Elementary School, namely on the ground floor, while the children from minority and majority have just a minimal possibility of contact during the breaks.
According to their statement the division is better for the children, they don't feel bad and are satisfied when among their own.
The school adopted measures on the basis of which it had created special classes that are separated from ordinary ones because of the outflow of pupils.
The parents also enrolled their children in elementary schools which hadn't been attended by single child of Roma ethnic membership.
According to the school principal, the Court made the said decision despite the fact that it had been provided with arguments that the attendance in separate classes had been improved, less children stayed down, and completed thus the school in lower grades.
This case triggered a wave of feedback also in the media.
However, the suit does not deal with a different approach to ^hildrens^boardmgat^ll^^^^^

According to news from the media, from among roughly thirty next first years students, 22 children are enrolled into the first grade at the Elementary School in Šarišské Michaľany, and about eight are enrolled outside the village.
The Headmaster of the Elementary School with Kindergarten in Šarišské Michaľany, Jaroslav Valaštiak believes that the troublous atmosphere after the court judgment has disappeared among parents, also persuasions at parent associations were successful of that none of the children would be exposed to insensitive changes.
52 However, the fact is that in an ongoing school year, the Elementary School in Medzany is attended by 90 children from the district Šarišské Michaľany.
In Medzany, they expect a higher attack of applications in the summer for the dislocation of children to the Elementary School in Medzany also from higher grades from the Elementary School in Šarišské Michaľany, as according to the decision of the court, from the next school year the school remedy and guarantee equality to all students.
From September 2013, integrated classes of first grade students should be created, but still there will remain eight purely Roma classes from which Roma pupils will be gradually moved into non-Roma classes.
Education is the Key to Future
As early as in 2008, a school reform was launched, which brought several problems persisting up till now.
The accession of a new Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport in 2012 opened issues of other necessary changes with respect to the regional education system and universities.
Also two teachers from Dobšiná drew attention to problems and the alarming condition in the education system in 2012 who in an open letter to the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport unreservedly highlighted problems that they tackle every day in their work.
The content of the letter points out insufficient preparedness of children from marginalized and socially disadvantaged groups for the performance of compulsory school attendance.
Such children often have a poor vocabulary and have no basic hygienic habits.
For children from such an environment who did not attend pre-school establishments, the zero grade is a must.
The letter indirectly confirms what has been discussed in professional circles for a long time.
Children from marginalized and socially disadvantaged groups are often included in special schools rather due to their social backwardness than due to their mental.
"Please realize that the children picked up a pencil for the first time on the enrolment, they are unfamiliar with toys, cubes, objects or games that would develop their thinking and movements.
These children are lagging behind the other not for two, but for four years, and we want them to perform tasks placed on first grade pupils, when they are on the level of a three years child."
54 With respect to this issue, the introduction of compulsory 3 years pre-school education is discussed for children from risk
53 Details see in: Čorňáková, V.: Rozsudok o segregácii Rómov podľa riaditeľa neovplyvnil zápis prvákov, (According to the Headmaster, the Judgment on Roma Segregation did not Affect the Enrolment of New Pupils), http://sabinov.korzar.sme. sk/c/6692146/rozsudok-o-segregacii-romov-podla-riaditela-neovplyvnil-zapis-prvakov.html.
The letter further mentions a lack of interest among parents in the education of their children, unpreparedness of pupils for classes, vague addressing of particular financial benefits granted by the state, and the issue of birth-rate of minor pupils of elementary schools.
As one of key problems the teachers perceive excessive bureaucracy in the education system and constant changes of state educational programmes.
Talks about the possibilities of adapting the content to be rendered individually, which present individual compilation of the school curriculum as positive, are the absolute disadvantage, and even a real complication in the transfer of student to another school where they cannot follow their learning process because their curriculum is different.
In their work, the staff of the Centre meets with opinions of teachers according to which perhaps it would not be necessary to change the education system in Slovakia.
Naturally, these are problems which have persisted for long and do not relate only to 2012.
Excessive bureaucracy should be reduced by a Departmental information system, which should be put into testing operation on 01.01.2013.
The current information about the status of the readiness of the system has not been published yet at the website of the Institute of Information
The personal statement of teachers is a direct testimony from Slovak school practice.
The teachers give testimony of what is part of their daily educational practice.
They describe a phenomenon that they personally meet with in their work and express their subjective critical attitude.
The statement of teachers expresses their personal experience from the village of Dobšiná, district Spišská Nová Ves, which is 330 kilometres away from Bratislava.
"Dear Mr. Minister,
Our letter is a reaction to the helplessness which we encounter in our daily work.
It is the testimony of us, ordinary teachers from the "distant East".
At the beginning we want to apologize that this letter is not written factually and formally, but is full of emotions and indignation, but apparently it is already too much for us and our imaginary cup of patience has just run over.
We cannot react without emotions.
Our letter is just a reaction to the intolerable situation in the Slovak education system and dysfunctional and unjust social system in the state.
We believe and hope that it will be an impetus for the reviewing of the current situation and position of teachers.
In Bratislava, far away from your favourite "marginalized and socially disadvantaged groups," you have no idea about the stalemate we are forced to fight every day.
Come for a few days to experience problems that we have to deal with every day.
Let's look into our schools, finally meet with real students and sit down in the classroom for a few lessons.
Further we wish to note that this letter is not meant just for you.
We also want to begin talks about these problems in the general public.
Therefore we are sending this letter to the media and also publishing it on the Internet and social networks.
The situation is alarming, and therefore we want to avoid further displacement of solutions and ignoring the needs of education system and the public by competent parties.
We will not generalize and will specify the problems of our schools, even though almost all schools in the east have identical problems.
The greatest difficulty we have with students who are significantly socially maladjusted, they are almost exclusively students of the Roma origin.
We want to emphasize, however, that this is not about race, skin or biases and reservations against the Roma.
Students do not participate in the first lessons, leave the last lessons, and often run away from the school.
It is not rare that a student comes to school in the morning and out of a total of six lessons, he/she attend one or two, and without informing the teacher he/she wanders in the corridor of the school.
We are not able to search for and collect students who should be in the classroom but are not.
In addition, these students are often aggressive and arrogant, and there are different types of sexual harassment not only upon fellow students but also upon teachers.
The situation in some classrooms verges on systematic bullying of teachers.
It is standard practice that a student comes to school not only without a school bag, slippers, pencil case, hygienic bag, sports apparel, coloured pencils and drawing and other accessories for art and another education, but in most cases they come even without a single workbook, pen or pencil, completely without nothing maximum with a little snack.
Parents of these children are even the beneficiaries of the financial benefit of 17€, which is paid out mostly just to a group of maladjusted people and just for the fact that their children perform compulsory school attendance.
The question is for what reason the benefit is awarded to them as compulsory school attendance arises out of the law, and is therefore compulsory for all children without exception, and also why these funds are usually paid only to parents of a certain group of population.
Why these parents do not receive the said benefit?
Both responsible parents and the general public are umbraged by such positive discrimination, which can be called only a mockery of conscientious families.
We also want to note that the benefit is paid to parents of children from socially disadvantaged environment and is paid also if the school attendance of the children at school is regularly and grossly violated by truancy and other educational problems.
They come to school because "it is boring at home, and at school, at least they will have a fun."
And for them fun means disorderly conduct, which causes problems to all units of the school, paradoxically, usually except themselves...
For reasons of briefness, we will not mention advantageous prices of meal tickets in comparison with employed parents, but it is outrageous that lunch for the whole month (if the month has 20 business days) is paid by the parents of some children in an amount of 1.80 to a maximum of 3.20€ (depending on age), but an employed parent will pay more than 23€!
And lunch belongs to a student only for his/ her attending the first lesson.
What of that he/she did not bring any pen, exercise book, pencil, or homework.
Not only did not he work on the lesson at all, but he/she caused some quarrels, and the teacher lost one third of the lesson trying to establish discipline and a working atmosphere.
Again, the question is why they can further cause such anarchy?
Why the competent authorities and bodies do not control that child allowances meet the purpose and provide basic needs?
In their hands this form of assistance would not have the desired effect at all, and as a result the teachers are forced to complicate their work even by bringing these supplies to students for individual lessons every day!
Nevertheless, they are thankful for them as the supplies from the state present the only way how the learning process can be fully provided.
However, parents do not like this and we meet with cases where a parent visits the school for the first time when he/she comes to dispute and demand the supplies to be put into their own hands, so that they can sell them.
Different types of financial benefits the parents of these children receive do not ensure the basic needs at all.
It is not rare that in winter months the children come to school in leaky boots and a jumper.
Teachers regularly bring home different types of "souvenirs" in the form of fleas and other parasites or viruses starting from hepatitis to streptococcal and staphylococcal diseases.
A couple of times a year they bring 'pets' from their houses to classrooms, such as mice, rats or cockroaches.
To complete a real picture of the real condition of their "socialization", we must mention the condition in zero or first grades of the elementary school.
The vast majority of children are not trained at all, they have never attended a kindergarten and some do not know the Slovak language at all, they have never picked up a pencil and never drawn, they are unfamiliar with toys, colours, and during the first weeks of their stay with us they are not being taught the first letters, numbers and colours, but are getting familiarized with running water, flushing the toilets, blowing the nose into a handkerchief instead of sleeves, and basic self-service and hygienic habits.
Later we expect they will learn two other languages, which is not real as they do not speak even Slovak.
They are not able to denominate common objects, which are unknown for them, they never met with such things before.
Are you surprised that special schools are full of Roma children?
But why?
Please realize that the children picked up a pencil for the first time on the enrolment, they are unfamiliar with toys, cubes, objects or games that would develop their thinking and movements.
These children are lagging behind the other not for two, but for four years, and we want them to perform tasks placed on first grade pupils, when they are on the level of a three years child.
We cannot provide them with equal access to education when they do not start at the same "starting point."
They have to catch up with 6 years without stimuli, without leadership and education!!!
How should we integrate the majority when they present more than a half of the total number of students in our schools?
We consider it essential that children from socially unsatisfactory environment pass a compulsory zero preparatory grade!
Otherwise, they are not able to fully benefit from the first year (and often even throughout the school attendance) and are unnecessarily subjected to constant failure and emotional traumatisation.
Deferment of compulsory schooling in these cases resolves absolutely nothing; on the contrary, the child will lose a whole year (because the family will not care about him again).
Thanks to the zero grade the student will learn the Slovak language, basic hygienic habits, get used to the school system, and get at least some basis for further learning.
In a questionnaire (SSI questionnaire) you have asked us recently how we provide equal access to education for children.
How can you even think that education of these children is equal when they are hungry, thirsty, dirty, tired (because the parents were "celebrating" at night and they could not sleep, or they watched over their younger siblings), have scabies, lice, their scalp is inflamed, scratched and full of crusts and fester, because the parents do not want them to treat it sparingly, it is more comfortable to cut out their heads bald (both boys and girls!!!) so that they are ashamed to go among the people?!
Just a few maladjusted children in the classroom will prevent the progress of other classmates.
Therefore, do not be surprised that parents of brighter children prefer to enrol their children in schools outside their place of residence to prevent daily fighting against undignified conditions of neglected children.
They with that they children get education according to their intellect, which is not hindered by students with lower intellect, or just extremely socially neglected who are unable to proceed accordingly.
Maladjusted fellow citizens quickly become accustomed to the benefits that are offered to them by the state and get used to the idea that everything will be free, that they get a care, while they even do not need lift a finger.
When someone wants some kind of participation from them in improving their life situation, they are even angry.
So a couple of maladjusted citizens will peacefully live their life in several council flats (because one will not last for, and when it is completely demolish, they will get a new one from the state for free), they will have a lot of children (not to miss something, they start at the age of fourteen), each time they receive support, benefits and everything but the kitchen sink, but during their whole life they will not pay a single cent, produce anything for our economy, they only suck and receive all available forms of social "assistance."
It's a vicious circle: They are poor because they have no jobs - they have no jobs because they are uneducated - they are uneducated, because they are not interested in education.
Although it is not directly linked to education, an opinion of the amount of maternity benefit could also arise which is comparable to the amount of mother who has not produced a single penny for the state, and mother who worked for years before the childbirth and paid a lot of money into the state treasury.
Why this productive group of population is not supported by the state, but on the contrary, is discriminated against and the state complicates their life due to financial unavailability of housing (since a working man will never get anything for free, and if he/she wants to have housing, he/she must contract debts who their whole life), lack of work, miserable salaries...
We are asking, where is the logic here, and where is justice?
drink away and spend the money in a few days, but a university graduate or undergraduate who is jobless no at their own guilt (!) must be fostered by parents until reaching 26 years of age?
Neither these productive parents nor young graduates have the right to absolutely nothing?
To any form of support from the state???
Maladjusted parents usually do not have absolutely any work habits, they do not have to get up in the morning and go to work, and therefore, they even do not wake up their children and prepare them for school.
Children wake up, not knowing what time it is, and go to school alone; older children must take care of younger ones because parents are sleeping.
Naturally, they do not come to school in time, and they even do not dream of a snack, or just have to eat a few of dry rolls for the whole day.
The solution could be boarding schools, but it is not enough to start education at the age of six years.
The problem, which should be solved is the sexual abuse of the minors.
The number of pregnant schoolgirls in the lower grades grows not only in our schools.
It is not acceptable that a sixth grade pupil is seen by society as worthy mother who is to educate a child!
They are not able to care of themselves either?
After all, they are unable to take care even of themselves!?!
What facilities will they provide, what education will they give, what emotional support, how will they develop their personality?
Disabled CHILDREN generate disabled children, and into what conditions?
These children are doomed to live in undignified and inhumane conditions.
Not only do they set a negative example to other students, but they are not able to end at least the compulsory attendance in an acceptable way.
Notwithstanding the recognized efforts by the school, which through various preventive techniques, discussions and educational activity on lessons tries to prevent premature childbirths, the problem further persists.
Girls (often before the age of 15 years) are often pregnant with much older men, and even in this respect the state does not act in any way and the men are not prosecuted.
The situation is alarming!
In the academic year 2010/2011, our school four pregnant girls, now we have 5 pregnant schoolgirls and three girls with an individual learning plan, who are on maternity leave!
The officials, instead of imposing penalties, paradoxically even give them advice on what to do to get extra money and squeeze what is possible from the state like from a milk cow.
Therefore, all children born to our pupils (and who get money for them) are placed in the care of grandparents who get additional benefits for them.
Instead sanctioning the grandparents for having neglected education and permitting that their child became a minor, irresponsible and unprepared parent too early, they even profit from the situation.
We propose to provide financial benefits to a maximum of 3 children.
If they want to have more, it is up to them whether they will be able to subsist independently.
Do these children have the right to live in dignity?
Where are their rights when they live in one room with twenty other people in the dirt, kid, hungry, have lice, fleas, without water, electricity, toilet, their legs are bitten by rats every day, every day they can see their patents or other household members having intercourse before their eyes, even they are often sexually harassed or abused.
We should seriously think about setting the social system in this area.
Otherwise future generations of genetically damaged, non-productive and maladjusted children will be produced, which in the eyes of their parents are only a means for the funding of their vagabond lifestyle.
This population should produce our pensions?
Apropos: Can you imagine that in the current situation a teacher after 40 years of teaching will not live to reach his/her retirement?
Anyone who has ever been a teacher, or at least knows] something about the background of school, knows how extremely difficult and exhausting this profession is (especially from the psychological and emotional aspect).
Every working man deserves to retire with dignity and in at least some physical and mental strength, and not only to eke out a living during a couple of unfulfilled years after.
If policemen can retire earlier after some years of service (including the ones who were sitting in an office all the time), why not teachers?
Do not they deserve it after years of extremely challenging mental, emotional and physical strain?
It would be very appropriate to address this question.
We have a huge amount of obligations, orders and restrictions for teachers, but any possibility of self-defence or the power to intervene have been taken away.
We must do everything, but we can do nothing...
Is there anyone who will stand up for us?
Who will protect us?
But every day, the teacher must withstand insults, threats, vulgar worlds, degrading comments, taunts or sexual allusions or slurs of students without a word.
Students secretly film teachers with mobile phones and post it to the Internet with impunity.
Despite it no one considers the current situation as alarming, or at least worth of attention and solutions.
On the way home they will tear it up happily and scatter on the ground.
Why should they be bothered about such matters as behaviour or grades when secondary schools will want everyone including students with grades four because funding depends on the number of students.
So do not be surprised that students achieve below-average level in tests for students of the ninth class who do not have any motivation to learn because they know that they will get to the school without any effort.
We perceive it as absurd and absolutely astounding that students showing almost no progress get into secondary grammar schools?
Where will they find a job after the secondary grammar school (and they'll even end it up as schools reduce the level of education to report students progress)?
Or shall we send the "intellectual flowers" further to universities (because it is true that in fact anyone studies there)?
The whole education system loses its reputation!
Thus we reveal another shocking fact: We produce a bounty of seemingly "highly educated" graduates who are in fact sometimes absolutely ignorant, whereas our country has a lack of skilled workers and experts in the field of manual labour.
Universities do not reflect labour market demands at all!
In addition, on the expense of the above-mentioned less skilled graduates, the clever students do not get adequate education, again because of the reduced criteria and demands for students.
In addition, graduates are often unprepared for practice.
An example is just the teacher's profession where young teachers starting their career don't learn everything important at university, but only during their work after starting their employment.
Another striking fact is why in today's schools different bureaucratic and formal actions the teacher and the school have to perform are much more important rather than providing what the student needs as to the educational, emotional, and human aspect.
Where is the essence, which for us still remains a student and not a paper?
Where is the synergy of units?
And to make matters worse, every school year we have to cope with new national education programs, following which we must change our school curriculum and constantly change the curriculum.
It is not acceptable to modify these documents every year!
The education system must be united, and not such a chaotic anarchy and inconsistencies!
It is a shame of our education that we do not have textbooks for each subject, and if there are some, they are outdated or the subject absolutely does not correspond with the curriculum for the relevant year.
If the Ministry does not plan to devote their time to the compilation of textbooks, specifically for each class separately, we require at least the issue of a comprehensive set of materials (such as for civics), which will include all and elaborated topics for the subjects for all primary school classes in summary (and this material would be followed by another collection for secondary schools).
Worksheets and other tools for some subjects do not exist at all.
But textbooks, worksheets and other tools for students with mental retardation are perfectly developed for each grade.
Can someone explain the logic?
And by the way, this is a common phenomenon that the state supports and favours just groups that not only will produce nothing in return, but they even abuse it, and productive members of society who bring benefits and profits for the state, even support such individuals.
We do not want this idea to sound disregarding and discriminating against students with mental retardation.
We just ask for the same rights, opportunities and conditions for the other children.
In addition to all these tasks and requirements that are imposed on teachers, still we continue to educate, chase credits, pay for courses, travel to training and spend time on "artificial" and inefficient education to increase qualifications.
Most of the credit education courses are absolutely pointless and the teachers do not learn anything innovative there.
They are tacky, useless courses "for effect" to fill someone's pockets.
A responsible teacher who cares for the work does not need any forced motivation in the form of credits, but develops continuously throughout life, according to their needs and the current situation.
If you want to motivate teachers, you should rather use the money for financial rewards of their work.
If you can find money for golden, diamond or platinum "parachutes" for highly-placed positions, please kindly find finances also for education.
Thus instead of relaxation and time for rest and necessary psychological hygiene, we are the slaves of credits, to earn at least some money to our unsatisfactory salaries, which are comical compared to other professions.
Why then we wonder that so many teachers are burnt out?
No preventive techniques will help us against the burnout syndrome when we have no time to rest and recover strength.
And instead of the monkey business which you place on us and reproaches on how we fail in the role of teachers, here you are, teach us how to motivate us to teach maladjusted students who have absolutely no internal motivation or motivation from the family and society.
Organize courses for us on how to teach them; we are not able to do it in such circumstances and under such conditions.
It is an era of computers and advances in technology, but is it really necessary to artificially implement technology in schools to such an extent?
We should teach with the assistance of the latest computers and ICT, but our students even are not able to wash their hands thoroughly, cut nails, sign, or say hello.
And therefore Catholic education should belong to each pupil's personal life and his family in the private area.
In many cases teaching of religion causes problems.
Catechists do not have the time and intention to teach it.
They are absent regularly, and therefore the religious education must be substituted by other teachers, or students are moved for that time to a group of children with ethics, and it undermines the whole learning process.
Catechists ignore their responsibilities in completing various school documents, and also basic attendance for lessons.
Class teachers have to ask them, sometimes with the pen and class-book in their hands, to report the topics taught several weeks ago.
Even though the classes were not taught, they enter them into the classbook.
We will not mention the actual content of religion.
Of course sanctions for frequent absences and failure to perform duties are not known among catechists.
Students with religious education often lack valuable, sometimes essential knowledge and skills that they develop on ethics.
Indeed, the ethical education teaches pupils to distinguish good and evil, moral and immoral, they learn to create stable, functional and meaningful human relations, train their empathy, learn sociability, cooperation, creativity, tolerance, assertiveness...
Do children from a religious background need these skills?
Ethics should be part of education for every child, it is not the opposite of religious education, but religion in any way cannot replace ethical education!
The teaching of ethics would be better if the groups had fewer students and the teacher would be able to devote more time to them on an individual basis.
It is important to recognize the need of moral education especially at a time when the responsibilities and duties of the family are permanently moved to school.
Parents turn a blind eye to problems and think that their child is not problematic, but on the contrary, that teachers are the bad, unjust and vindictive fools who complicate their lives, and even dare to ask for and demand cooperation in dealing with their educational problems with children.
Of course they often present their views before the children who then see their parents as their allies against the school, and they provoke a lark more because they know that each time parents will stand on their side.
A very convenient solution for the parents is to put all the blame on us, but still expect that the school will take care of everything, in addition to the basic knowledge that the school with teach them decent behaviour, empathy, sociability, good manners, functional human relations.
Of course we should attend to drug prevention, sexual education, education for marriage and parenthood, creating a positive relationship to culture and tradition, patriotism, respect for all forms of life, tolerance to diversity, ecology...
However, they have forgotten that their role and responsibility is to cooperate with the school in this effort, and not place the burden and responsibility on the school.
We need from them and expect upbringing in the family, but also assistance and cooperation in the education of THEIR children.
Not accusations, slandering and attacks against teachers.
Where is the respect to the teacher profession and to education itself?
We ask the competent persons to finally start to address specific problems and stop ignoring the horrible situation in our schools.
Citizens themselves have increasingly taken "justice" in their hands.
Do you really want civil disorder or war?
Because we feel that is where this is going.
We address our complaints and our call for help not only to the Ministry of Education, but also to the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, because these two components must necessarily cooperate to address the situation and not just "play in their own sandboxes" and turn a blind eye to problems.
If you want to see the real condition and a realistic picture of our time, please come to look at the situation which prevails in many schools in towns or cities of Eastern Slovakia.
In conclusion, we would like to express pleasure that in some areas of our complaints perhaps the situation will improve and proposals regarding the enrolment of students in secondary grammar and uniformity in education will finally end successfully.
But we also hope and believe that also other problems mentioned in the letter will be solved.
Even though this letter might sound like a mere complaint and reproaches, it's just a desperate cry for help.
We love our work, we've chosen the teaching profession in the belief that we will create a "better world" - but under these circumstances it is not possible.
We wanted to raise children, educate young personalities, teach them to discover the beauty and cope with the problems of life.
Let us teach, let us educate, but in conditions that we deserve, and which also "our" children deserve...
According to an answer from the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport, most of problems pointed out in the open letter will be solved progressively.
Specific solutions, however, are not known at the moment, and according to some statements there has been no consensus for specific measures yet.
For reasons of objectivity and completeness of information, the Centre also includes the reply from the Minister of Education in the Report, in which he reacted to personal testimony of teachers from Dobšiná.
"Dear Mrs. teachers,
Immediately before the end of the school year, your open letter was delivered to me in which you openly, indignantly and with all your heart informed me of your bitter experience.
I believe that behind all your words and sentences is not only frustration, but also bitter experience, and ultimately also expectations and desire to set our education system on solid feet, from the head to feet to help change our presence.
I appreciate, dear Mrs. teachers Erika Polgáriová and Eleonóra Liptáková, your true-heartedness you use to describe the matter to which we often turn a blind eye or criticize the situation in private, where such an open and critical attitude is and was missing.
To tell the truth I confess that I do not consider your just anger as an attack against the members of the national minority or as contempt for socially vulnerable groups.
I perceive it as a desire not have rights superior to obligations and an effort to return decency where it is absent.
And, first of all, not to have teachers, educators, line staff and ancillary staff in our school facilities and schools only with obligations, and not to have children, pupils, students and parents not only with obligations, but also responsibilities and duties.
And that is without doubt exactly what we strive to reach.
I do not feel at all that this letter sounds like "a mere complaint and reproaches" of which you were afraid on writing the letter.
On the contrary, it is a valuable testimony of those experiencing a hard school reality.
If you did not care of the education and our education system, certainly you would not waste time by writing an open letter.
Right to Education
condition, and remedy it jointly.
For more than 20 years our education system and the whole society have been exposed not only to social or economic transformation, but also to unsuccessful experiments.
Also therefore we are witnesses to imbalance between rights and obligations, and also to that certain parents do not provide their own children with education and with their indolence they bereave them of positive human models.
Our Ministry and our school organizations have failed in many aspects; we often relied on a sort of self-development, which, however, has led us even to a larger trap and marasmus.
I definitely agree with the statement that "the school produces absurd numbers of students who will not find a place in the labour market and who are without any social and work habits."
I partially disagree with the statement that this condition is a result of" wrong operation of the policy of this state."
I also agree with you that excessive fertility can be seen as a gainful activity.
In this field we are still lagging and we are not able to act strictly, exactly and fairly.
As you say, dear teachers neither in "dirt and stink" can the parents expect family benefits.
I am not afraid to write that one of my sincere efforts is to open boarding schools, it is a model, a pilot project from European resources, which gives the above opportunity of education to children from socially vulnerable families so that the children of careless parents get dignified living conditions.
Naturally, it is on the principle of willingness, consent of their parents and relatives.
It is a demanding journey, but we have to start.
Just like you, dear colleagues, dear teachers, neither I want to put up with these problems.
I am interested in changing them and I will search for a wide support on the level of ministries, towns and municipalities, and also of charitable organizations to finally deal with things as a whole, in a targeted manner and with patience, instead of experiments.
A problem which arose more than twenty years or decades ago, cannot be solved within human powers in an electoral term.
However, each decision made must be part of a mosaic of decency, fairness and responsibility, as well as order and solidarity that we need so much.
Right these values must be present among us.
Therefore I will sign every step which will protect the teacher profession.
Education is a chance which must be guaranteed by the state.
Those who do not care for it disqualify themselves.
Each of us is writing a CV with his/her work and acts.
In the position of the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR I will do my best to have my political CV accompanied with the modernization of education system the result of which will be the change of conditions in our education system, quality teaching, satisfied parents, rewarded and unterrorized teachers.
Thank you for your sincere lines and courage in writing them, I do appreciate you and am in prostration and respect for your sincere words.
Almost everything that you write confirms my words about a bad education system, absurd chasing of credits, production of graduates for labour offices, striving for business, and not quality, an open and

common school and underestimation of my pursuit of an increase in demands for education, selection interviews, certificates of apprenticeship and leaving examinations.
After the first hundred days in the chair of the Minister of Education I want to assure you, dear teachers, of my personal determination in which I will further continue and support also your efforts for changes in our education system.
On the nearest occasion, in the new school year, I will certainly visit, obviously out-of-plan, also your school, and I will very happy to meet you and personally thank you.
Yours faithfully and best regards, Your Minister..."
One of the first problems that the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport started to solve after elections, is the issue of job opportunities for graduates of particular schools, and the level of education.
The Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport agrees with the view that it is not correct that also students with bad results get into secondary grammar schools.
Slovakia has a problem to adapt to the needs of the market.
Here we have lots of graduates of secondary schools or universities who in practice are not able to find a job.
Information about the share of secondary school leavers of the unemployed, however, varies.

leavers in a period under review was 19.3%.
The most numerous group of unemployed secondary school leavers58 was the leavers of specializations (former secondary technical schools).
Their number was roughly between 6 362 and 11 014.
It was followed by leavers of specializations with extended practical training (specializations with leaving examinations of former secondary technical schools; 4 244 - 8 859), and the leavers of training specializations (former specializations without leaving examinations of secondary technical schools; 3 010 - 5 833).
The least reported number was for secondary grammar school leavers (1 794 - 2 965) because a considerable part of them studies at universities.
According to the words of the State Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport, Štefan Chudoba "It is not possible that only a little bit more than 6% of secondary technical school leavers finds a job in the specialization, and more than 30% ends on record of the labour office.
At the same time, the purpose of amendment is to react also to the solution of surplus specializations in whose leavers the labour market

Based on adopted changes, the regional self-government unit will set by a generally binding instruction, upon discussion in the regional council for professional education and training, the number of classrooms of first grades of secondary schools in its territorial scope.
The specification of the number of classrooms only applies to classrooms financed from the budget chapter of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport.
61 Despite efforts for the connection of market needs and education, the measure has also its opponents.
According to activists, the adoption of this standard and also of amendment of Act on Financing of Schools will start "systematic eradication of private and religious and also of some uncomfortable public schools and educational facilities."
General Part.

A special part.
With respect to admitting pupils to secondary grammar schools several teachers drew attention to the fact that the system allowed even students with grades four to get to a secondary grammar school, and thus many pupils of elementary schools lost motivation to learn.
Secondary grammar schools did not begin to perform their function of elite schools which were to be a preparation for university studies.
On the other hand, the question is whether the precondition of good grades will lead to the desired result, or whether there will be "artificial creation" of good pupils who meet the criteria of average, where elementary schools will reduce demands on pupils on purpose, which in the upshot will result in a decline of the knowledge level, i.e. to the opposite result compared to the plan.
In safeguarding the right to education

• Set the system of state educational programmes to prevent the occurrence of frequent changes.
According to the School Act, leisure centres are educational establishments.
According to an educational programme of educational institution, they ensure educational, co-curricular and recreational activity of children, parents and other persons up to 30 years of age in their leisure time.
Leisure centres direct the development of children interests and other persons concerned, create conditions for the development and improvement of their practical skills, take part in the formation of habits for useful spending of their free time, and according to children needs, ensure the competitions of children from elementary and secondary schools.
Leisure centres can provide teacher and expert assistance in the area of working with children at their leisure time to:
a) schools and educational institutions;
b) citizens' associations conducting activities focused on children;
c) other legal entities or natural persons who apply for it.
From 01.01.2013, money will be provided to the municipality where the child aged 5 - 15 years has the permanent address.
According to new rules, the municipality will get finances for each child regardless of whether they attend leisure activities or not.
From such allocated financial resources they finance the costs for co-curricular education of children in their own leisure centres irrespectively of the age (up to 30 years of age), and in private ones up to 15 years of age.
64 The new system does not take into account whether the municipality has a leisure centre or not.
In addition, the amount of allowance per child was reduced from roughly 190 EUR to 65 EUR.
One child can be reported only once, i.e. one allowance will be provided per child.
63 Article 116 of School Act.
64 Statement of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport regarding the questions of the Centre dated 20.02.2013.
65 See details in Article 7a of Act No. 597/2003 Coll. on Financing of Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and School Facilities, as amended.
According to statements of the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport, changes were required with respect to cases of the misuse of the previous funding system of leisure centres.
As samples they gave a leisure centre which provided services for three football courses divided into theoretical football, forwarding football and non-condition football, whereas according to the Minister such activities could have been managed by one course.
Or a case of another centre which provided several tens of courses.
One of the courses was to be a horse riding course, whereas the centre did not have any horse or stall.
The Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport also added that the self-governing authorities would be asked that each centre regardless of the founder should get money that belongs to the child attending the leisure centre.
66 Voices calling for a change in the financing of leisure centres have sounded for a long time.
The council of the Association ofTowns and Communities of Slovakia discussed this issue as early as in February 2010.
After this meeting the council of the Association of Towns and Communities of Slovakia asked the Ministry of Education to prepare a draft of laws regulating the activity of elementary schools of art, leisure centres and school centre for extra-curricular activity and their detached workplaces in the interest of eliminating ascertained problems and obscurities in their establishment, audit, financing and in the reporting of the number of pupils.

The amendment also means a higher administrative burden.
According to other statements, the change in the financing of leisure centres does not solve problems with the transparency of finances spent, does not prevent the creation of fictitious courses.
The provision of financial resources to a municipality is not purposefully bound, therefore it is not clear how to safeguard that these resources are really granted by municipalities to leisure ^entres^ttendedbychiidren^^^
Therefore many leisure centres planned to raise the fees, in such case, however, not all families will be able to afford the financing of spare time activities for their children.
Uncertainty occurred in many leisure centres as in December 2012 they did not know how much money they will have in 2013.
For that reason some leisure centres proceeded to the reduction of their activities; the centres wish to keep most of courses at least until 2013, even though in a crisis operation.
Future existence of courses and whole leisure centres depends on how the situation will develop.
Municipalities have time to announce a decision on allowance until 30 April 2013.
As early as in 2012, leisure centres started to negotiate with municipalities regarding the granting of allowances.
The results of the negotiations vary.
the neighbouring self-government authorities which should provide the finances.
According to a statement of the Vice-Mayor of Spišské Podhradie, before the beginning of January they did not have a clear answer from the surrounding municipalities.
A similar statement provided also the Mayor of Liptovská Revúca who had been contacted by five centres.
He stated: "We announced to them that primarily we would support our school and schools in other municipalities which are attended by several our children.
If we gave money to centres, these courses would not be kept"70 The problem was solved in a different manner in the village of Dolné Sŕnie.
The deputy Mayor, Róbert Hajbal thinks that when the money is refunded by the state to the municipality, then it should be sent to the centre so that parents need not pay extra charge.
71 Bratislava also does not have the problem with the financing of leisure centers.
As at 01.02.2013, most of contacted municipalities did not contribute to extra-curricular education of their children.
Generally municipalities refuse to contribute for centres having a seat outside their municipality also
70 See details: Teliščáková, D.: Centrá voľného času zráža nový zákon na kolená (New act beats leisure centres to their knees), available at http://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/255795-centra-volneho-casu-zraza-novy-zakon-na-kolena/.
72 At the beginning of January 2013, other municipalities were hiding behind the statement that they did not have enough information, and therefore they have not acted yet.
The same was the case of the town of Turany, which in their answer to the letter from the Leisure Centre Kamarát in Martin states: "According to our information, the resources for extra-curricular education of children aged up to 15 years are to be provided to municipalities in the form of a special subsidy, and then we would use them to finance extra-curricular education.
It is questionable whether particular municipalities will follow the recommendation.
Despite critical voices and concerns about whether the relevant financial resources finally will be used for the given purpose, the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and
72 Statements of the Leisure Centre KAMARÁT in Martin regarding the questions of the Centre.
And that is because as per Article 6 par. 12 a) - c) of Act No. 596/2003 Coll. on State Administration in Education and School Self-Governing Bodies and amending and supplementing certain laws, as amended, the municipality shall determine by a generally binding order for elementary art schools, language schools, kindergartens and educational institutions in its founding competence, and for non-state founders of elementary art schools, language schools, kindergartens and educational institutions established on the territory of the municipality (including the leisure centres established on the territory of the municipality):
Details on the financing of elementary art schools, language schools, kindergartens and educational institutions;
Period for the submission of data under which they finance elementary art schools, language schools, kindergartens and educational institutions;
Supervision of the observance of law in the generally binding order of municipality shall be ensured by the competent prosecutor.
If citizens are not satisfied with the decisions of self-government authority in the field of distribution of financial resources for extra-curricular education in municipalities, they can participate in negotiations of the local board of representatives and seek a higher allowance for extra-curricular education than the one determined by the municipality in the generally binding order.
The change applies not only to the transfer of money to municipality in which the child has permanent residence, but also that the money is provided for children aged between 5 and 15 years, i.e. in fact does not apply to a majority of secondary-school students who constitute a considerable part of members in some leisure centres.
Regional self-government units provide financial resources only to facilities in their founding competences.
At the end of 2012, a Petition for just, economical and non-discriminatory financing of education system started against changes in the education system.
In any case, changes in the education system are necessary as the financial resources designated for the financing of child extra-curricular activities should not be misused.
Financing depends on the budget of municipalities, and therefore it is not simple to harmonize it with the start of school year, but the selected model is not optimum.
In conclusion, it is necessary to mention that if needed, the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport does not exclude changes in the system of financing of leisure centres, which will eliminate ascertained defects.
It will be possible to evaluate the situation only after 30 April 2013, when it will be clear how municipalities will use allocated financial resources.
In accordance with the above facts regarding the financing of leisure centres, the Centre recommends in particular:
• For the preparation of other fundamental changes in the financing, set forth the validity of Act so that the entities concerned have an opportunity to get information on it before the beginning of the school year.
• Set stringent control mechanisms to prevent the misuse of financial resources.
• Adopt methodical guidelines in time to ensure common rules adopted on the level of municipalities.
Lack of Text-books
According to the cited Article 13, not only distribution but also the purchase of text-books, learning texts and workbooks is provided by the Ministry of Education, Science and Research of the Slovak Republic.
this website is the current information on the text-book policy of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR (valid regulations in the field of development of textbooks, information on the process of text-book formation, publishing scheme for the current year and other documents related to the publishing activity of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR).
According to the above provision, it is clear that for education in schools, text-books are used, other learning texts and workbooks approved by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport, which are in compliance with the objectives and principles of the School Act, whereas for education in schools it is possible to use also text-books recommended by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport.
Approved textbooks, learning texts and workbooks must contain an approbative clause issued by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport on the basis of expert opinion proving their compliance with the principle and objectives of upbringing and education with the national educational programme in the performance of which they are to be used.
The approbative clause for text-books, learning texts and workbooks for specialized subjects specifically in medical specializations is awarded by the Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic, which publishes it at their website.
A list of textbooks, learning texts and workbooks for which an approbative clause was awarded, is published by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport in their publishing means and on the Internet.
Part of the approbative clause is also specification of the validity of approbative clause.
of a new text-book.
In schools in the competence of central state administration bodies pursuant to Article 109 of the School Act, text-books, learning texts and workbooks for specialized subjects are approved by the competent central state administration body, which also award the approbative clause.
Text-books for which the approbative clause was issued in the school years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 as at 13.02.2013, were and are gradually distributed to schools.
The procedure and rules in the selection and approval of text-books, learning texts and workbooks in the printed, digital and other suitable form for kindergartens, elementary schools, secondary schools, elementary art schools, language schools and educational institutions in the Slovak Republic are regulated by Directive No. 10/2011, which is also published at www.edicnyportal.sk75.
74 Statement of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR regarding the questions of the Centre.
The following can be found on the website:

Other activities related to the publishing activity of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR.
The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport provided free of charge, based on orders from schools, text-books designated for pupils of special elementary schools.
Transcriptions of 17 new reform textbooks into Braille script, and electronic versions of text-books for visually handicapped pupils on CD carriers were provided.
The topic of a lack of text-books has resonated in Slovak society since 2010, which the Centre highlights on a regular basis each year.
With respect to the school reform, several issues have arisen.
One of the issues that brought about the reform of education system was an alarming lack of text-books in elementary and secondary schools.
According to the statements of the Trade Union of Workers in Education and Science of Slovakia - Bratislava, Trade Union of Workers in Education and Science of Slovakia - joint Boarding School, Special boarding elementary school and kindergarten, Elementary school and kindergarten at healthcare facility, Practical school - Levice, Reeducational centre and Slovak Association of self-administration schools, in the school years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, in particular text-books for higher grades were absent, such as physics, biology, Slovak language and mainly mathematics.
77 Statement reg. the questions of the Centre.
Comparison of expenditures and real requests of textbooks in the years 2012/2013 and 2011/2012
Comparison of percentual ratio in fulfillment of supplied textbooks to schools and their requests in the years 2012/2013 and 2011/2012
According to the statements in the media, however, in the school years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 text-books were missing from SS - history, physics, mathematics, or chemistry.
78 Statement of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR regarding the
A not negligible fact is that the process of formation and publication of text-books is a demanding and time-consuming creative process.
The problem is an annually undersized amount of financial resources allocated for the purchase and distribution of text-books.
For the school-year 2011/2012, 3 919 236 text-books were delivered of a total number of required 7 177 780.79
simpler and shorter.
Teachers have to copy materials, which causes a higher financial burden for schools.
• New text-books and workbooks are being prepared, but the Minister is not satisfied with the content as they contain serious mistakes, e.g. mathematics for grade 3 of elementary schools.
On the other hand, however, according to statements of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR, reform text-books in elementary and secondary schools are drafted according to principles and objectives set forth according to the School Act, and they fulfil all criteria

2. The Trade Union of Workers in Education and Science of Slovakia
For the subject ethical education we do not have curricula adapted to the mentally handicapped (in any educational variant).
Topics are too difficult; teachers work without text-books and workbooks.
82 Statement of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR regarding the questions of the Centre.
They fulfil the parameters for grades 3, 4, 5, 6.
Text-books for certain subjects are of very poor quality.
Physics is quire difficult for pupils.
History contains lots of dates, which are quite difficult to understand.
It would be necessary to revise these text-books a bit.
I find the text-books out-ofdate; pupils need an illustration and examples and tasks from life, which I miss in text-books.
Some I find quite difficult and some unnecessary."
In 2012, again it is necessary to observe a continued lack of text-books in elementary and secondary schools.
Even though the exercise of the right to education is not linked to text-books only, their absence may adversely affect the quality of educational process.
The provision of textbooks is regulated centrally by the Ministry of Education.
The process of formation of text-books, approval, publication and subsequent distribution to schools is subject to central regulation.
The process has been too complicated and slow in the long term.
Today the system of the provision of text-books regulated by the Ministry is not able to safeguard timely distribution to pupils.
A lack of text-books in Slovakia causes, as is given above, that if teachers want to keep the basic continuity of educational process, they are absurdly forced to violate the copyright, by copying educational texts, publications, workbooks, etc. and by their information and downloading through the Internet.
In September 2011, the project fully started in selected schools.
The Ministry of Education started to use the programme as an alternative which should help solve the problem of a lack of reform text-books.
The aim was to test digital curriculum Planet of Knowledge in the educational process and obtain opinions of teachers on opportunities of its application for the organization of teaching (for the preparation of teachers, presentation teaching at school, and preparation of tasks for pupils).
The opinions of teachers and pupils on the Planet of Knowledge were not unequivocally positive or negative.
However, it results from the pilot operation that the project Planet of Knowledge can solve the problem with a lack of basic text-books.
Moreover, they are in compliance with the European Classification of Education ISCED (levels developed by the UNESCO, which serves as a tool for comparison, compilation and presentation of statistical data on education within particular countries) for the first and second grade of elementary schools and for secondary schools.
Pupils and teachers have available digital text-books in mathematics, physics, chemistry, natural science and biology.
According to a statement of the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR, digital text-books are a great instrument for disabled children.
For instance, the software will allow children with visual impairments to read the text-book or teaching material through human voice.
So even though they cannot see the text directly, they can learn using voice, or the weak-sighted can enlarge letters.
On 18 December 2012, the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR announced on a press conference, the conclusion of agreement for the purchase of digital content area Planet of Knowledge from a consortium of suppliers.
The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR decided that the importance of the digital content Planet of Knowledge was much higher than partial defects of certain its parts, and for this reason decided to buy the Planet of Knowledge and offer it to pupils, teachers and parents as a supplementary source of teaching.
The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport informed that the project would be put into live operation in 2014, but progressively to all schools the content Planet of Knowledge would be made available during 2013 with respect to the schedule of training.
The website eaktovka is one of tools for those pupils who did not get the classic text-book (e.g., Slovak children living abroad), but it offers an added value to teachers - their own preparation for lessons by compounding teaching materials from different textbooks.
The access to text-books is free for everyone who register on the portal.
It is possible to download 65 audio records from the website www.eaktovka.sk.
The portal eAktovka provides text-books in digital form to teachers and pupils of elementary and secondary schools.
Text-books are available free of charge and for everyone who register on the portal.
In addition to digital versions of textbooks, pupils and parents can find freely available teaching materials and recommended literature on the portal.
The portal is placed in the Data Centre of the Ministry of Education.
Until 31 January 2012, the portal eAktovka was in testing (beta) operation, which was to help to test it and detect failures.
The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR, in the school years 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, provided a total of 63 digital versions of text-books, which are published on the portal www.eaktovka.sk.
Statements of selected institutions and schools regarding the digitization of text-books, putting the Planet of Knowledge and website eAktovka into practice85:
The Slovak Association of self-administration schools: "It would be good if every pupil had a PC and Internet connection at home" „We have only good experience" in introducing the Planet of Knowledge and eAktovka.
The Trade Union of Workers in Education and Science of Slovakia Bratislava: "...
I am against the digitization of text-books, not for it, as the pupils spend a lot of time in front of PC and Internet anyway and an increasing number of them wear glasses because of it, and this way the contact of a pupil or student with the "real" book from the library disappears..".
Moreover, again the offer does not include text-books and materials for special schools."
However, it is certainly getting an increasingly stronger position as a complement of standard teaching and in certain subjects digital content/digital text-books will "win" over standard text-books.
In 2012, the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR announced an appeal for the submission of applications for a subsidy for the renewal of education and upbringing in educational areas Mathematics and work with information, and A man and nature.
87 Out of 17 delivered applications, 5 were excluded as they did not fulfil the appeal conditions.
3 applications were selected from evaluated applications by the Committee for the award of subsidy, the amount of which was approved by the Minister of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR.

Chapter 2.
Right to Education
The state has not adopted sufficient system measures for timely safeguarding of necessary text-books with current texts in the required quantity.
The state has not provided a material source of knowledge on the territory of Slovakia even though it had been asked to do so by pupils, their parents, and by teachers.
The state did not do it even despite that it is a matter of course.
The performance of Slovak Republic's international contractual obligations for the protection of right to education is insufficient.
Therefore the Centre recommends improving the coordination of creation, selection of text-books and ensure their timely distribution to all schools.
The Centre considers it the basic function of the state where state failures are inadmissible.
Otherwise the essence of education is endangered.
The lack of text-books is a serious all-society problem, which points to the fact that the "text-book policy" must go through principal changes.
The right to education is the right which is guaranteed for everyone not only by the Constitution, but also by international documents.
The right to education contains not only an access to education as such, but also the provision of a certain level and quality of education.
According to data of the OECD, which has been dealing in the long term with issues related to the quality of education, we can observe that certain preconditions exist, upon the fulfilment of which we can speak about quality education.
Teachers must always print themselves necessary source documents and materials, and today also the parents of children must share the costs.
Digital text-books should contribute to a significant enrichment of the teaching process in many Slovak schools, which will help partially cover also the problem with lack of text-books; either in the form of website eaktovka, or through the project Planet of Knowledge.
Moreover, it is necessary to realize that albeit Internet materials are considered to be a very good source among teachers, but they will not replace the basic material for pupils, the text-book.
The Centre again recommends:
1. Solve the problem with missing text-books, teaching texts, and workbooks as soon as possible
2. Ensure the publication of all text-books used in elementary and secondary schools in the SR on the Internet.
3. Safeguard printed form (not only electronic) for all text-books, teaching texts, and workbooks, also with respect to the health of children and mainly to their eyesight.
3. Extremism
Statements of Famous Rock Singer and Frontman of a Band J. Ráž in the Media
In an interview for the magazine Instinkt Jožo Ráž talks about China as a Great Power which will take control of the world in the future.
Among other things he said: "I am no racist but I fear the Chinese - there are so awfully many of them.
This is why I have two guns at home.
As soon as the Chinese wave comes, I will knock off the first 45 Chinese and leave the last three bullets for me and my family."
Singer's words caused an immediate reaction, and the Slovak Police filed a motion to the department of firearm licences to initiate administrative proceedings.
They were even thinking upon whether Ráž should be sent for a psychological examination.
"If any doubt arises regarding the capacity of firearm licence holder, the Police is entitled to apply for a new medical or psychological report," said Michal Slivka from the Police presidium.
of Criminal Law Unit of the Ministry of Justice, Ráž's statements are OK.
The chairman of the Association of Gun Holders Legis Telum and the lawyer Ľudovít Miklánek hold an opposite opinion.
According to him, Ráž's words are "apparently racist".88
We can positively evaluate that despite many negative statements of Mr. Ráž, in each article we identified a negative assessment of the words.
And not only from members of family, colleagues and friends, but also the opinions of experts.
New Year's Speech of the Mayor of Zlaté Moravce
We must stress separately that the incident was used for the promotion of a political party.
In general we would expect the a person in the mayor's post will not be associated with similar statements.
Chapter 3.
Extremism
According to information of the association People Against Racism, after the Zlaté Moravce mayor's New Year's speech, two skinheads attacked Roma children whose parents were at a party in Robotnícka Street in Zlaté Moravce.
The Roma parents allegedly decided to act and chased the skinheads away from the place.
"In the speech he said "white race" three times in the context that it would never be oppressed in Zlaté Moravce or in whole Slovakia.
He called non-working people parasites, exactly like the Slovak Brotherhood is crying it out," said a witness according to People against Racism.
At that time the mayor was allegedly under the influence of alcohol.
After his speech allegedly two skinheads attacked Roma children whose parents were at a party in Robotnícka Street in Zlaté Moravce.
The Roma parents decided to act and chased the skinheads away from the place.
"From a bar situated only a few meters away other skinheads rushed out, and verbally attacked the present Roma with words against their colour of skin,"describes the witness further.
The Roma did not bring a charge, but the other party did.
The witness confirms the version that the police had not intervened on the spot.
He says that the reason was that there was no-one to intervene against.
"The Roma started to leave the place where they had a party after protecting their children.
Then the Roma called in the Police once again after the end of party to get home peacefully," said the witness.
The information of People against Racism has already been referred to the Minister of Interior and to the Inspection Services Office.
More than one thousand people came to a protest meeting which was organized by Marián Kotleba and his followers in amphitheatre Zlaté Moravce.
The protest was meant to be a reaction to the New Year's battle between the Roma and the members of majority population in the town.
At some moments, however, it rather looked like a pre-election meeting.
Kotleba appealed to people several times from the stage to elect his political party Ľudová strana Naše
The mayor of Zlaté Moravce refused a racial motive.
"I did not say the words.
I only said that I do not want to tolerate parasites.
I do not regret at all, I have nothing to feel ashamed of and nothing was stirred up, no turmoil.
Only elections will be soon.
", he concluded.
Statements of the Mayor of Town Prešov on Facebook
Another mayor who hit the media in the past year because of his statements is the Mayor of Prešov, who albeit did not say the statements aloud, but used social networks for it, namely Facebook.
The Mayor of Prešov wrote on the social network literally: "Today since four o'clock in the morning we have been liquidating a "black", really a black Roma settlement between Prešov and Malý Šariš...
I kindly ask the Plenipotentiary of the Government for Roma communities Mr. Pollák to claim his right to sheep."
Several experts agree that today the extreme right discovered the "Roma topic".
Once popular motives are not sufficient, they moved to settlements.
These respondents for instance with respect to the Roma supported restrictive or open discriminatory policy.
Recently certain self-governments have marched for it.

They moved into anonymity, and are hidden in various associations and focus on the Roma issue.
According to statistics, in the past year the Police revealed 271 criminal acts with a racial motivation and extremism.
Two years ago the Police reported 115 such cases.
According to news in the media, the Police consider their success that they are successful in discovering and explaining these crimes to a greater extent.
Similarly, after social changes the character of crime in the 1990s approximated to the form of crime in countries with developed economy.
Post-war trend of crime is shown in particular in these aspects:
94 15.05.2012, www.pravda.sk.
a) The number of cases of the socalled domestic violence is growing, in particular tyranny and abuse of women and children, as well as of elderly and powerless persons.
b) Purposeless brutality and ruthlessness increases, especially for moral and violent crime.
c) The share of criminals from among children, juveniles and young adults increases.
d) The share of women among the perpetrators of criminal acts is growing (in our statistics the trend has appeared up till now to a relatively low extent).
e) The share of criminals from among ethnic and national minorities, migrants and foreigners is growing.
To a certain degree this is proved also by growing but already rather high shares of unexplained and non-registered latent crimes.
The basic rules for material, fair and balanced reporting should highlight growing concerns about the responsibilities of the media for the reproduction of biases, stereotypes and hateful manifestations in increasingly diverse Europe.
Criticism is usually centred at the text of information, what the reporter is saying or writing, or what words are used and what they mean.
Only in rare cases journalists are asked to explain what they know and believe, and how they understand the issue of diversity.
As is already stated above, the manifestations of racism during sports events are a regular phenomenon in Slovak sports scene.
However, Slovakia is not the only country which is fighting against this problem.
Fortunately, certain tools exist that could be applied among sport representatives in Slovakia.
One of them is also:
Media Against Racism in Sport a joint programme of the European Union and of the Council of Europe focusing although not exclusively on sport because it is considered an important area for the development of social cohesion, and also an important sector for investments in the media industry.
However, media coverage of sport does not reflect the social and
Chapter 3.
Extremism
With this applied approach to the coverage of sports event, the MARS wants to support innovative methods of models in the media which could be reproduced in all media branches for any form of media coverage, not only sport.
After the match with Trnava, Seydouba Soumah accused three Spartak footballers of racist insults during the duel.
This incident was reported in 34 articles during the year.
The Nitra forward reasoned his impulsive action when he had insulted the referee and attacked two players.
According to her, the Police did not receive any notice of racist insults on the playground.
98 The player pushed him into his face, he was insulted, but the referee Marek Mastiš did not end the match of 9th round of Corgoň liga Nitra - Trnava.
He made a serious mistake.
"It was the most serious mistake of a referee at this match.
He and his assistants will bear responsibility for it," announced the Chairman of the Referee Committee Dušan Krchňák.
99 Even though at the 71st minute the Nitra player Soumah hit the face of a player from Trnava Karhan and then the referee Marek Mastiš, the match was completed.
Only twenty-six years old Mastiš was sanctioned by the Referee Committee, and cannot arbitrate matches until the end of autumn.
In the match the arbiter excluded also three players of Nitra, while Trnava completed the match full.
According to Krchňák's statements, all exclusions were fair.
Cards were not questioned.
The Committee agreed upon it in the ratio of 8:0" The Referee Committee analysed sixteen points of complaints from Nitra players.
The Referee Committee agreed with Nitra only in three cases.
However, originally the match should have been whistled by experienced Kružliak.
Soumah complained that Trnava players vilified him with racist comments.
Allegedly Mastiš and his colleague did not hear anything.
If referees had heard insults from Trnava, according to Krchňák's words, they would have acted.
The case was presented as unilateral statements of Nitra players.
Trnava clearly objected to such accusations.
According to Spartak Trnava's statements, the words of Seydouba Soumah were not supported by legally relevant evidence.
The Trnava captain Peter Čvirik and the player Miroslav Karhan rejected a statement that Soumaha had said racist insults to anyone of the team.
"We have written confirmation of it from referees and delegates that at the place of their movement no similar insults were reported," said the chairman of disciplinary board Štefan Kridla.
The Nitra side, however, sticks to their guns.
"An impulsive moment of our player was preceded by provocations from Trnava players, so I am not surprised that he acted this way.
I do not uphold for him, but the audience comes to watch such footballers.
100 See details at 21.09.2012; Sme; p. 23; SPÁL Pavol.
102 No tapping devices or equipment is installed in the playground, which could detect racist words, claims the general manager of Nitra Jozef Petráni.
Such events cast negative reflection upon Slovak football, suspicions of racism are monitored carefully also by the UEFA.
According to the words of the spokesman of the Slovak Football Association "We have also experienced a shame if I can say it like this, because due to racism in a match with England UEFA sanctioned us not only with a monetary penalty, but also by closing the playground for one national match" 104
Even though with respect to the seriousness of racism, it was necessary to outline at least basic issues in this Report.
Slovak media do not pay equal attention to the manifestations of racism.
During 2012, several protest events were held, where also extremist views were presented.
103 22.09.2012; Sme; p. 16; Spál Pavol.
and protests, in 2012, a special response had also an open letter of the teachers from Dobšiná105, linking the issue of employment at schools and the social system and the Roma issue.
The letter appeals to adopt a comprehensive solution to everyday problems that the teachers encounter.
And it points out very sincerely everyday situations where tension arises in society.
Fortunately, this degree of "meeting with them" is not as high as in some other countries"
The society's opinion is that the development of extremism is only possible if families and schools have less space to participate in upbringing.
By civic society the family and school are still perceived as the basic pillars of individual's education.
Therefore each attempt to weaken them will lead to indirect support and growth of extremism.
105 The whole letter of teachers from Dobšiná is included in Chapter 2.
Right to education.
The second place was racial attacks against the Roma, which is perceived as the result of professing of racial superiority of extremists.
The efficiency of the Police in fighting against extremism is generally understood by society fifty fifty, whereas citizens feel to be partially sufficiently informed about police activities in fight against extremism"106

System measures focus on dealing with the wide issue of population groups, citizens endangered by extreme poverty, including the socially maladjusted.
Proposed measures will relate in particular to risk families which will be identified on the basis of a combination of the following factors: parents education, the parents income, the level of parents long-term unemployment, material background, indebtedness of the family, truancy in the family, and expected failure to speak the teaching language at the time of start of elementary school by the child.
According to a statement of the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Roma communities of 18.02.2013, the Roma reform the Right Way will relate to all Slovak Republic's socially maladjusted citizens.
The purpose of the reform is to help improve the living situation of citizens who are responsible and active towards the family, society and the state, and enhance the socio-economic position of citizens being in material need or threatened by extreme poverty.
The content of the reform is published in parts.
Up till now 10 pillars of the Roma reform have been presented, the area of Education and the area of Enforcement of rights.
Education
Chapter 2 deals in detail with the part of Roma reform focused on the issue of education.

Enforcement of Rights
The area of "Enforcement of rights" belongs to the most important pillars of the efficiency of operation of civic society, observance of the rules of civil co-existence, in particular within the coordination, competence, performance of tasks and obligations of state institutions towards citizens and vice versa.
Chronic wrongful acts may not stay without adequate reaction of the state, therefore the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Roma

Rights of National and Ethnic Groups
of the Plenipotentiary of the government of the Slovak Republic for Roma communities of 18.02.2013 the Right Way - the Roma reform in the area of Enforcement of rights proposes, inter alia: introduce an alternative punishment in the form of minor municipal services, if it is not possible to pay the financial penalty, the parent will bear responsibility for delinquent and criminal-law activity of children, it will be possible to include all social assistance benefits in the system of special recipient without the necessary consent of the recipient of benefit; the form and amount of social benefits will be linked to family's behaviour.
These proposals present a reaction to the problem of repeated commitment of many misdemeanours and subsequent factual immunity from prosecution of socially dependent persons as they do not have resources to pay penalties, and no other legal tools exist for the enforcement, i.e. no real sanctions.
This condition, according to the authors of the reform, increases the feeling of unjustness and insufficient protection against criminality in society.
The Roma reform proposes that the form and amount of social benefits should follow the degree of family's criminality.
The system of law of the Slovak Republic is based on individual responsibility of a natural person and the principle of individuality also applies in imposing sanctions.
A natural person who is fully capable to enter into legal acts bears full responsibility for his/her acts.
If a crime is committed, the person is criminally responsible, if they reached 14 years of age (for the crime of sexual abuse it is 15 years).
A natural person is also personally responsible for any misdemeanour to a person if the former reached 15 years of age.
For the above reason we cannot accept that the whole family should bear responsibility for a illegal conduct of some member of the family, and that the family should be sanctioned in the form of a certain modification of social benefit which belongs to them according to law.
On the contrary, the Criminal Code sets forth explicitly that a penalty is intended to punish only the offender, so as to minimize the impact on the offender's family and his close
In other matters the person shall be represented by the guardian, his/her parent.
In the relation parent - child, the parent shall not only represent his/her child, but shall also be responsible for his/her upbringing until reaching lawful age.
In civil-law context, the rights and obligations of parents are regulated in particular by the Act on Family.
Part of parental rights and obligations is also systematic and consistent care of upbringing, health, alimentation and universal development of minor child.
Any failure to duly perform parental rights may result even in the restriction or suspension of the exercise by the court.
If parents neglect the upbringing of their child, they may commit a crime - corrupting the morals of youth.
According to the Criminal Code, any person who, even by negligence, exposes a person younger than eighteen to the risk of debauchery in any manner stipulated in Article 211, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of up to two years.
The Centre stresses these facts also with respect to the proposed measure where it is proposed to penalize parents if their child, even though not criminally responsible, commits a delict or crime.
Thus it is not necessary to prepare new measures; but it is necessary to consistently implement the existing ones, including in the form of criminal-law prevention.
According to the said proposal, the form and amount of social benefits should also be influenced by pupil's behaviour at school.
Child's behaviour is primarily the issue of the family, upbringing and parents care for the child.
According to the reform, also debt against the municipality could be repaid in the form of public beneficial works, which the municipality could not accept before.
The said form of sanction measure will have a sense and substantiation, if it causes to such sanctioned person not
The performance of work may also favourably affect and form the worker himself/herself and motivate them to make some side money in the form of activation works or minor municipal works on a voluntary basis, after the end of sanction.
Criminal-law sanctions present a higher infringement of personal rights and freedoms, and thus can accomplish the protective, educational and preventive purpose of sanction measures on a specific offender and the whole society.
Rights of National and Ethnic Groups
The Roma reform proposes the introduction of the status of increased protection for the teacher's profession.
With respect to the conduct of teaching activities, teachers have the position of a protected person.
According to the Criminal Code, a protected person shall be understood as a public figure or a person who fulfils his obligations prescribed by law.
Moreover, if we build on the definition of the term of protected person and a circle of protected persons, we discover that in the education system not only the teacher is a protected person, but also the child, i.e. the pupil.
It results from it that albeit a teacher of elementary school has the position of protected person, but this position does not guarantee any protection against verbal, physical and Internet attacks by pupils to them, and it also does not allow the application of more severe custodial penalty as pupils are also protected persons.
Moreover, it is necessary to consider also:
• The provision of Article 94 the Criminal Code, under which persons who are over fourteen and under eighteen years of age, shall be understood as young offenders,
According to the above stated, it is necessary to search for new options for the expansion of protection of teachers position as the current legal regulations of the relevant issue seem to be insufficient.
The failure to deal with Roma issues for decades escalates the tension in society.
In 2001, almost 90 ths. inhabitants reported to have been of the Roma nationality, i.e. 1.7 percent with permanent residence in the Slovak Republic.
Now they are already 105.7 ths., which is almost two percent of the total number.
The Roma reform Right Way concentrates on the principle of bilateral benefits for the Roma and the state.
The solutions of these and other areas are included in the Roma reform, which was presented to general public for the first time on 15 October 2012.
The reform is a set of restrictive and system programmes, whereas it identifies people who behave in a responsible manner and those who are irresponsible.
poverty, and to solve it, the collaboration of all central, regional and local institutions is necessary.
The Roma population is endangered not only by poverty, but also by social exclusion and discrimination; poverty is linked to demographic conditions, developed from unemployment, resulting from the conduct of low qualified jobs with a low pay, or a lack of education, and discrimination.
109 A certain minor part of inhabitants, however, with respect to their educational, cultural and social level is not able to ensure adequate housing for them in a standard manner and way.
Marginalized groups of population are distinguished by
109 A concept of state housing policy until 2015.
Adopted by Resolution of the Slovak Government No. 96 of 03.02.2010.
Localization of construction may not deepen spatial and social segregation but it has to be the means of integration of the inhabitants of the affected Roma community.
The issue is mainly the distance from the municipality and access to public services used jointly by Roma as well as non-Roma community in the municipality.
Involuntary segregation is linked with the risk of creation of socially vulnerable racial and ethnical minorities not integrated into the labour market.
It is the expression of social differences and social inequality of the society.
Within majority society animosity to the segregated group of inhabitants may grow and this may result in their stigmatization.
Specific Cases in Slovakia in 2012
After Ostrovany, Michalovce - part Angi Mlyn, Trebišov, Sečovce, Lomnička, Prešov, Vrútky and Plavecký Štvrtok, during 2012, segregating walls were built also in Partizánske, Zlaté Moravce, Sereď and Veľká Ida.
The inhabitants of 24 flats in Ulica 1. mája Street in Zlaté Moravce built a fence, which fenced them against the neighbouring Roma.
They say that the Roma made a mess below the windows, dirt and disorder.
The town supported the idea and issued consent to the partition of communal land with a small construction.
The fence is only from the side where the block of flats neighbours the Roma block of flats, there is no fence from the other side, so it is possible to get to the block of
The mayor also says that the location is well known among the municipal policemen, as attacks against people, riots and devastation of the environment occur here.
According to his words, the Roma did not have a problem with the fence and got used to it quickly, and he claims that the Roma were not isolated from the surroundings, but they only fenced their access to the next block of flats where the people wish to have order and no rubbish.
The town of Zlaté Moravce takes also positive steps for the Roma community.
In Ulica 1. mája Street, a large-capacity container is available for free.
The council house uses also field workers to work with the Roma community.
The town also launches a project of civil Roma patrol or a project of training for socially vulnerable groups of town inhabitants.
Thus people from the locality can get behind the gate of the area only through one entrance and according to their words they feel like prisoners.
The mayor says that they had to act this way due to higher security, order and due to the non-payment of waste removal.
The town replaced small containers by one large-capacity container, which is situated in the courtyard and will be emptied upon the payment of particular transports.
The container is inside the courtyard behind the fence, which prevents the occurrence of mess below the dam.
The mayor stated that this was the final solution.
The self-government claims that the new wall is used, among other things, also for sports activities, i.e. squash or basketball.
According to the mayor's statement, antisocials live there who cause problems to the inhabitants of houses in neighbouring Komenského Street, and the fence should allow better control of maladjusted fellow citizens.
This measure is meant to change the behaviour of the citizens affected.
The local authority decided on the fence on demand of the inhabitants, by Resolution Number 331/VIII/2012 at the 11th ordinary session of the local authority on 28.08.2012.
According to the Resolution, the development of fence was approved in order to obstruct free access of maladjusted inhabitants between Streets Nábrežná and Komenského and its re-routing to Škultétyho Street and Námestie SNP Square.
The mayor stresses that the fence need not be a permanent solution, and after a year they will reassess whether it performed its purpose.
Among other things, the town introduced also civil Roma patrols thanks to which the order and co-existence has improved in Nábrežná ulica Street, established a Committee for the protection of public order at the Municipal Authority, which also covers the activity of voluntary patrol "Night Ravens".
According to statement of the town of 13.02.2013, Partizánske performs also social field work, field workers provide social, civil and legal advisory, advisory in the field of social prevention, employment, anti-debt counselling, advisory in attending to official issues, execute family redevelopment, educational and cultural programmes.
With out-of-school extra-curricular activities for children they attempt to increase their interest in education and eliminate truancy.
Out-of-school activities also have an educational function, the children learn to be friendly among them, tolerant and establish sound human relations.
Field workers directly visit families, and they collaborate with the Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, physicians and other specialists.
Protest Marches in Slovakia
The situation with maladjusted people escalated in several towns.
It proves also a "March for the rights of decent people" in Partizánske, in which hundreds of people participated.
The citizens' initiative "Give stop to antisocials in your town" came with an idea to organize the march.
Signatories to the petition demand more efficient enforcement of the following measures:
• Deeper protection of the fundamental rights of decent people against antisocials;
• More stringent legislative sanctions for antisocials restricting the human rights of decent people;
• Payment of social benefits conditioned by performed work of the beneficiary of social benefit;
After the event in Partizánske, two protest marches were held also in Bratislava entitled "Jointly for decent and secure life!
Jointly against corrupt politicians and antisocials!".
According to the organizers, the purpose of event is to support Slovak patriotism, national union, remember the national history, as well as to highlight all social and economic problems threatening the future of Slovak nation.
However, the above marches were organized in the spirit of extremism.
The assembly was organized by Oskar Dobrovodský who has long-term problems with inadaptable Roma neighbours in Malacky, together with Marián Mišún.
At the march appeared also Marián Kotleba's followers with the flags of organization Slovenská pospolitosť (Slovak Brotherhood).
Thus in practice the above stated assemblies serve also for the enforcement of extremist and racist opinions and present a potential threat to personal security of Roma citizens.
Thus towns and municipalities could, by systematic work with problematic citizens, limit various extreme forms of such behaviour, which consequently would not lead to marches and a serious escalation of human relations.
In front of a Roma settlement in Veľká Ida (Košice - okolie district), in September 2012, a wall was built, which was almost two hundred meters long and 2.5 meters high.
The owner of the land where the wall is built is only the municipality, and the construction of the wall was financed from the budget chapter of the municipality.
The wall is built from precast units containing a metal support inside; it is a prefabricated fence system.
According to a statement of the municipality of 31.01.2013, the wall serves only as a safety barrier as before its development, there were regular car accidents and crashes between people and transport facilities in the incriminated section.
It results from the statement that the construction has brought positive results as for the past half-year in the above section no car accident happened, and dogs do not run out the settlement to the road and do not threaten the drivers.
Equally, the road cleanness has improved because the Roma children have no access to the road and to not pollute it with different objects, pieces of glass or other waste.
All of these factors have contributed to higher road traffic flow and safety.
The municipality also adds that the coexistence of the Roma and non-Roma population in the municipality has always been on a good level, and in the municipality no nuisance occurs between the Roma and non-Roma population.
It also results from the statement that mainly particular individuals are unsatisfied who shortened their route there before the construction of wall.
However, despite it the wall does not present any obstacle as it surrounds the settlement only from one side from the road.
In 2012, the municipality Veľká Ida obtained a non-refundable financial allowance from the Slovak Government Council for the prevention of criminality for the development of a community centre.
The Centre holds an opinion that the construction of barriers is only a fast and illusory solution; in fact barriers between groups of people deepen more.
Acute problems in co-existence must be solved immediately, between the mayor and the Roma Mayor (vajda).
In the future the development of walls or fences can cause more serious problems than those that led to its development.
The Centre holds an opinion that the development of any barriers, both symbolic and real, leads to an idea that on the one side are the "bad" and on the other are the "good".
The Centre evaluates critically that it is the area of human rights where the self-government chooses outdated methods instead of efficient application of modern legal means.
Building of walls is the expression of authoritative physical separation of the people living in one social room and amounts to a factual confirmation of inequality of citizens in everyday life.
Concurrently, it is a manifestation of lacking prevention of discrimination.
Self-governments argue that fences and walls are meant as the protection against dirt, waste, conflicts and also serve as anti-noise screens.
In addition, they should be used also for sports such as tennis, squash or basketball.
On the average one anti-Roma wall is built every third month in Slovakia.
It is evident that the number of anti-Roma walls does not drop; yet municipalities and towns in Eastern Slovakia become an idol for towns in Central and Western Slovakia, which accept the model of isolating walls.
In our society the need for public discussion on existent social differences, their tolerability, separation and incipient segregation of certain groups of inhabitants, level of tolerance towards them and the conditions of acceptance of such inhabitants lingers on.
Analysis of the state of facts and synthesis of obtained information on the part of the Centre follows from numerous respective questions and answers from individual towns and municipalities.
Current practice refers to the fact that the constructions often affect the Roma population directly or indirectly.
On the contrary, it diminishes social cohesion among the people.
Pursuant to Article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination the States Parties particularly condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.
Despite this obligation in the Slovak Republic in practice there are constant cases of segregation in the field of housing, and this trend is even growing.
In the Slovak conditions, residential segregation occurs in the form of construction of walls separating Roma blocks of flats from other parts of residential areas, concentration of socially excluded groups in blocks of flats on the outskirts of towns and villages, as well as the existence of Roma settlements as such.
With respect to territorial segregation, the Centre considers to be inevitable to implement a clause for the protection against segregation into the prepared text of amendment of the Building Act, whereas the Centre presented its arguments also to the Ministry of Transport, Construction and Regional Development.
By implementing a mechanism of the prohibition of segregation in the issue of building permits, i.e. at the initial stage of construction, the Building Act as the principal construction and legal regulation would undoubtedly contribute to the respecting of human rights and the performance of international obligations of the Slovak Republic.
The municipal authorities to:
2. If persistent criminality is a problem and the municipal police, e.g.
Chapter 4.
3. Place public constructions in the municipality so that there is no spatial and social exclusion of Roma community inhabitants.
4. In cooperation with the labour office with respect to the Roma population use more intensively the established supportive tools, such as the concept of special recipient.
5. Improve cooperation and communication between the parties involved, on the basis of an obligation in favour of the Roma integration.
6. Reflect this cooperation into positive changes on the local level by increased co-responsibility and strengthened capacities on the part of local authorities, civic society and the Roma themselves.
7. Care about urban planning, economic and territorial development with respect to Roma inclusion.
The Plenipotentiary of the Slovak
Communities to:
3. Pay special attention to most disadvantaged micro-regions and segregated districts.
4. Use effective monitoring methods for an assessment of the effect of measures for Roma integration.
State authorities to:
1. Enshrine in all relevant provisions of the construction law of the Slovak Republic the explicit prohibition of spatial and social segregation with respect to the distance of and access to public services and proportionality of the deployment of population groups in residential parts of municipalities or towns through construction.
The goal of the recommendation is to uplift the protection against any segregation from the level of conception materials to the level of the Construction Act and related regulations which regulate the construction industry legally and determine the approval and control mechanisms along with statutory sanctions.
2. Develop clear policies in the area of housing for the elimination of segregation.
Issue of Luník IX, Demolition of Blocks of Flats and Substitute Housing
Standard of living, to access to safe drinking water and hygienic facilities, to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, to safe and sound environment, to an access to sources including energies for cooking, to heating and lighting, to an access to basic services, schools, transport and job opportunities, to availability of such housing which would not jeopardize other basic needs, to an access to housing and subsidiary services without discrimination on grounds of gender, race, affiliation to an ethnic group and another status, to equal protection by laws and decisions of the court in the compensation of damage for the violation of right to adequate housing, to protection against forced eviction and destruction or demolition of furniture, right to select the place of residence and select where and how a man will live, and right to the freedom of movement.
Yet many Roma live in conditions which do not reach the minimum standards of average housing.
In certain regions of Slovakia segregated living still prevails and even expands.
Subsequently segregation seriously restricts Roma's access to education, employment or health care.
In the area of housing the Roma face also racist reactions of local non-Roma inhabitants and applicable discriminatory measures on the level of local authorities.
Perhaps the most significant factor dividing the Roma into several groups is their social-economic situation, which is closely linked to the method of housing.
In Slovakia, the major part of the Roma lives in homes which are considered inadequate.
Adequate living is understood as one which has an access to drinking water, energy for cooking, to

heating and lighting, amenities and facilities for washing, space for food storage, waste removal, sewerage, etc. In Roma settlements and houses many of such facilities do not exist.
An insufficient access to stable and safe housing affects many Roma who carry the burden of poverty in housing.
Most of informal Roma settlements and communities have no guarantee of legal form of housing, which means that their citizens have no control of what will happen to the house where they live.
Tenants' Rights and Eviction
The legislation related to the lease of real property, relations of the landlord and the tenant and eviction is enshrined in the Civil Code.
However, Act No. 599/2003 Coll. on Material Need does not distinguish material need for subjective and objective reasons, and thus we can assume that today nobody can apply the extension of notice period on grounds of material need for objective reasons.
The Act does not contain landlord's obligation to obtain a consent of court to cancel the lease contract, whereby the burden of proof is transferred to the tenant.
Over the course of three months the tenant must file a motion to the court and demonstrate that none of the conditions was met.
The tenant is not obliged to move out of and vacate the flat until a corresponding substitution of flat is provided to him/ her.
The tenant who vacates the flat is obliged to make a contract on compensation for flat within 30 days of delivery of written notice regarding the provision of substitution of flat; if the lease contract is not concluded unreasonably by the tenant, then his/ her right to substitution of flat shall cease to exist.
Luník IX is a borough in the city of Košice being part of the Košice II district.
In this residential area is the highest density of Roma population in Slovakia falling on one municipality (100%).
The name Luník entitles districts of the second largest housing area in Slovakia - Nové Mesto (also Terasa) consisting of eight such parts (Luník I-VIII).
After the construction of such parts followed the construction of an experimental district Luník IX, which was, however, situated at a marked distance from other Luník areas.
Luník IX is not considered part of Nové Mesto- Terasy and according to Act of the Slovak National Council 401/1990 Coll. of 1 October 1990 on the town of Košice, it is an independent city district with its own self-government.
Originally the city district Luník IX was designed as a housing area type ABC, which was to be occupied mainly by soldiers (A-army), policemen (B-security) and the Roma (C-Cigáni, Gypsies).
The construction started at the end of the 1970s when a Roma settlement Tábor Košíc was demolished near the centre of Košice.
In 1978, the first tenants were moving to the housing area, whereas units A and B came in reduced quantities compared to the plan, and thus as early as in 1981-1989 the housing area had a high concentration of the Roma.
From among 2 000 inhabitants they accounted roughly a half.
On the contrary, families causing no problems were gradually removed from there, if they had asked for it.
The capacity of flats in the residential area is 2 400 persons.
The most significant socio-demographical feature of the Roma population is its youth.
The birth-rate in this city district is 150 - 170 children per year; the mortality is roughly 5%.
Almost 90% of the inhabitants of this city district are debtors or bad payers of rent and energies; that is why they are disconnected from electricity, heat and hot water.
The debt of the inhabitants for electricity is more than 2.3 million EUR.
Out of 498 flats, 496 flats do not pay for electricity.
In 2011, the total debt for the rent, energy sources and waste disposal was 6.3 million EUR and is still growing.
According to official figures, 6.5 inhabitants fall upon one flat in Luník IX, but real estimates rely on the double, i.e. even 12 - 14 inhabitants per flat.
Unfavourable social and hygienic conditions of the inhabitants of residential area present a hardly soluble burden for the city of Košice, which is part of a complex solution to the Roma issue in Slovakia.
A kindergarten and an elementary school is placed in the residential area.
Bus line 11 goes to Luník IX, which stops only at selected stops.
It is possible to get on the bus only through the front door.
With respect to frequent attacks, drives on this route get danger money.
A civil Roma patrol should monitor the security in the housing area.
In 2011, an ordinary municipal police station was established there.

In Luník IX, blocks of flats have been demolished for several ears.
They placed the inhabitants of 70 flats into the residential area.
In 2010, the block of flats in Podjavorinská 2 and 4 was demolished.
In 20082010, the town-hall spent 820 ths EUR for the demolition of three blocks of flats with 100 flats in Hrebendová and Podjavorinská Streets.
In the past the town-hall argued that the repair of old houses in Luník IX would have been more expensive than the demolition and building of new ones.
The city as the owner had to proceed to the clearance of a block which was in the state of disrepair and with disturbed statics because it endangered the health and lives of inhabitants.
Roughly 225 inhabitants from more than 30 flats had to leave the flats, but most of them did not have valid lease contracts.
The city provided eight families which had either a lease contract or duly had paid for the flat or had a schedule of payments, with substitute housing directly in Luník IX.
Emergency housing in tents was provided to the others.
The city gives reasons for its measures by protecting the life and health of inhabitants.
113 Statement of the Police Presidium regarding the questions of the Centre.
According to a statement of the spokesperson of the town of Košice, according to a decision of the building authority, in November 2012, the Housing Company of the town of Košice sent appeals for the vacation of flats to the users of flats in Hrebendova Street 22 and 24.
Equally, in January 2013, the Housing company of the town of Košice sent appeals for the vacation of flats also to the inhabitants in Hrebendova Street 34 and 36.
The reason is disturbed statics of block of flats which was caused by the inhabitants by permanent damaging of flats and common premises.
Therefore an obligation to vacate them was imposed on the Housing Company of the town of Košice because any further residing of a block or flat is life and health threatening.
Possible demolition of the block of flats in Hrebendova 22,24 and Hrebendova 34,36 will be decided by the competent building authority, and the Housing Company of the town of Košice will respect its decision, and will perform the obligation imposed on them within the statutory time limit determined by the building authority.
The demolition should cost roughly 110 ths EUR.
The town of Košice is continuously mapping the situation in Luník IX.
With respect to damaging of houses due to concerns about risk, they regularly prepare expert opinions and in case that other life-threatening structures are in Luník IX, but there are no financial resources for demolition, the town will order the vacation of houses.
Opinion of Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Roma Communities
The Plenipotentiary of the Government several times suggested the establishment of a working group
for the city district Košice - Luník IX, whose member would also be a representative of the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Roma communities.
Proposals and recommendations of such established working group should be system and comprehensive for particular problematic areas - housing, health and employment.
Despite proposals of the Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Roma communities, the town of Košice decided for another option, namely for the establishment of a working group which deals with the solving of extraordinary emergency conditions in the problematic residential area.
The Government Office of the SR, within the Subsidy scheme for the support of social and cultural needs and solving of extraordinary emergency conditions provided financial resources for the mitigation of emergency condition in the location.
level-of living of the Roma community has been recorded in the field of housing.
The problem is not only a lack of tenements and blocks of flats, but also their technical condition which often endangers the life and health of its inhabitants.
Nowadays in the city district Luník IX the town of Košice introduces a multilevel housing system.
Luník IX has a kindergarten, an elementary school and a detached office of secondary schools (the Secondary Vocational School Komenského Košice).
Throughout the year the kindergarten is loaded to capacity and spatial capacities are missing to satisfy the needs of parents and children.
The elementary school is attended roughly by 1200 pupils living in the housing area, and belongs to the largest schools in Košice.
Much interest is not shown in secondary education, therefore only one class is opened.
In the school year 2012/2013, the school does not have available the allowance on students boarding.
In Luník IX, the unemployment rate is ca 90%.
The company U.S.STEEL Košice within cooperation with the town of Košice employees roughly 30 inhabitants of Luník IX.
At present no quantitative changes were recorded in the field of employment.
Jaundice emerges frequently, which is directly related to a limited access to water.
The town as the owner of present blocks of flats is obliged to take care of the technical condition of buildings to prevent any danger to life and health of the inhabitants.
One of independent chapters related to the focus is also continuous support of civil Roma patrols.
The staff of regional office of the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Roma communities in Košice, in 2012, organized 12 meetings with the staff of self-government authority of the city district Luník IX.
His/her activity will focus directly on "problematic" locations.
The Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Roma communities will work on the accomplishment of the targets of the Roma reform Right Way."
The town of Košice expressed their opinion that all measures taken up till now had a low effect or were not effective at all.
They also see low involvement of public institutions and leaving the solution only up to the self-government as problematic.
The town of Košice cooperates in an enhancement of the social conditions in Luník IX with the Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family - mainly in the field of measures of social and legal protection, ensuring a special recipient for social assistance benefits and child allowances.
The town of Košice also cooperates with healthcare facilities and non-governmental and church organizations, whereas they accentuate the efficiency of work with the pastoral centre directly in Luník IX.
In 2012, activities of the town of Košice in this housing area focused in particular on:
• Provision of activation works and minor municipal works;
• Support of employment - implementation of a project for Roma employment in collaboration with U.S. Steel Košice.
They say that "a subculture develops here depending on the social system.
Socially disadvantaged individuals are disadvantaged in that children are born into this environment and a considerable part of parents is not able to provide upbringing, maintenance and supply and the support for personal development of their children.
Lots of independent persons live in a small area together, without any uniting authority among them.
They understand democracy as everyone can do what they want.
An individual is not punishable unless he/ she crosses the borders of law."
They say that the financial aspect is also different as some of them are more or less able to obtain finances for them.
They claim that a part of families makes a living by working; and there are also persons who earn their living on the expense of others, and also persons living in poverty, and they are satisfied.
They see a problem in the passivity in searching for possible although minor solutions, whereby the financial loss increases, which is covered by taxes of the working population.
The main purpose of the Salesians is "to bring a system of the value of an individual, family and others.
To show those who wish to live in a different way what is valuable in them, help them develop the beauty sleeping in them.
To offer a chance for games and entertainment together with those who want to have a nice free time.
To support those who want to learn" In 2012, they had a contact with roughly 230 young people within a project "Extend your hand to vulnerable people from Roma environment in Luník Ix."
They offered leisure activities to children and young people, fellow groups for boys, girls and the youth.
Some young persons are already involved as assistants in managing groups and events for others.
They have taken steps of help to the adults within their possibilities - in crisis situations when the inhabitants did not have water and only one cistern came, they shared water.
Many nice and careful people live here, but they outcry those who like disorder as they have their morality for themselves and another one against the others.
Despite it the people in Luník IX change and wish to be different"117
Opinion of Municipal Police Košice, Luník IX station
The Municipal Police Košice, Luník IX station said that the "Roma youth spend their free time by standing in the street in front of blocks of flats.
Only very few of them perform an activity which would fulfil them or develop their abilities and talent.
Limited financial resources and resistance or reluctance of the majority population to take part in public matters, e.g. to report illegal conduct which they witness.
The parents do not teach their children the basic rules of decency as even they do
Rights of National and Ethnic Groups
The change of the social situation might help, and an enhancement of bad living conditions, and higher employment of the Roma."
The main problems of this housing area are:
• Poverty;
• Worsening of housing situation;
• Dependence on benefit schemes;
• Unemployment, limited access to labour market or low income;
• Low level of education;
• Low level of social support;
• Negative idols;
• Unhealthy life-style and neglected healthcare.
These problems are usually combined, accumulated, and in such combinations in practice they are very difficult to solve.
Efforts for dealing with such phenomena are not popular because the public perceives the solution as temporary as "simple" measures are taken, which are not in harmony with the present concept of human rights.
The "simple" measures, however, have only a short-term effect and do not deal with the essence, which in the long term results in even bigger problems.
Luník IX is a location with a strong concentration of problematic groups.
Negative phenomena increasingly concentrate here and thus a zone of social pathology arose in Luník IX, which was confirmed also by the town.
The young generation will hardly find a motivation here; positive examples and solutions to their situation.
Negative models often show the only solution to a bad situation, i.e. a way behind the borders of law.
responsibility into despair, closing into a community of jointly "handicapped", and the development of own rules for survival.
The main purpose of social work with the community in this housing area should be to teach the inhabitants abilities and skills on how to solve personal problems on the basis of own needs, their own future and their own children.
And the chance is here.
Participation in projects focused on the integration of this Roma community into society, however, should not end with the completion of a project, but the activities should continue further.
The purpose of projects should be, inter alia, working with people, strengthening of self-organization, encouragement of community spirit and stimulation of participation in the neighbouring society.
Social community services implemented in the philosophy of sustainable development of Luník IX should present not only the harmonization of sets of objectives and tasks of particular professions providing assistance, but also of priorities set by the community in mutual effective communication with respect to the reality of performance.
It is necessary to apply community elements of social work for Luník iX inhabitants in the field of services, social, educational, psychological, legal, medical activities or also in activities of self-help groups established directly in the housing area.
The solution of Luník problem will not be real without the co-existence of several pillars: the state, self-government and the third sector, as well as of the Roma as such.
It is commonly known that the issue of the Roma ethnic community has been considered an all-society problem for a long time.
It is discussed on various levels.
All Slovaks know Luník IX as a Roma Košice housing area where is dirt, waste and problems.
This city district, however, has already appeared in foreign media and is known mainly in countries where the Roma moved to find a better life.
It is necessary to deal with the housing policy of persons who end up in material need in a comprehensible and practical manner, and use the possibilities of social housing.
The Centre is aware of the necessity of independent decisions of self-governments made in the interest of citizens while observing the statutory procedures, but the Centre considers forced eviction as the last resort and an infringement of rights of each inhabitant of Luník IX.
It is necessary for each self-government to realize that organized concentration of the Roma in one location brings about problems that villages and towns must solve additionally.
Inhabitants without valid lease contracts who are provided with no substitute housing become the homeless after the eviction.
These inhabitants establish other illegal settlements including on private land.
In 2012, the town of Košice kept a record of fourteen illegal settlements on its territory.
The Centre emphasizes that each village and town should have a concept in place of how they will safeguard the housing for people with low or no income on their territory, or for they will create conditions for such housing on their territory.
Villages and towns should not forget crisis housing which provides temporary housing to those who lost it, and also should try to prevent such situations and strive to prevent the of occurrence of socially excluded locations resulting from the movement of people with low income to one place.
The Centre appeals to villages and towns to gradually transform segregated localities to common parts of villages and towns with standard housing, functionally interconnected with the surroundings, or equipped with generally available services.
Equally, the town of Košice should use more the concept of special recipient for tenants taking social assistance benefits.
It would mean in practice that social assistance benefits would be credited to the account of municipal authority which should debit the rental from it, and the rest would be paid out to people for instance in the municipal authority cash-desk.
Thus the town could prevent the occurrence of debts on rental for tenants in Luník IX who are socially disadvantaged.
Not only Košice but also other Slovak towns should have their own social housing policy in place and their own idea about safeguarding the right to adequate housing.
Equally, the Centre welcomes the plan to establish the so-called sample housing.
The city council has selected roughly 80 tenants for whom they plan to reconstruct sample houses from the rental revenue only for paying tenants with good payment discipline, where gradually all standard services associated with housing could be installed as an incentive element of special attitude to paying tenants in Luník IX.
3. Respecting the right to equal treatment, including in the context of the allocation of finances designated for housing, access to finances.
4. Taking steps aimed at the prevention of violation of standards regarding the right to housing by the state and its representatives.
5. Respecting the right of privacy.
6. Providing full guarantee of legal form of housing in all sectors of housing, with respect to all citizens.
7. Reacting in a constructive way to the violation of rights to housing.
8. Active supporting of persons, families and groups that are not able to meet their own needs of housing by its individual effort.
9. Building housing in the vicinity of job opportunities, schools, health care facilities and open space.
Sterilization of Roma Women
The issue of forced and unlawful sterilization of Roma women in Slovakia has resonated in national and internatio- nal discussions, opinions and reports for a decade and also has been the subject of the Concluding Observation of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 2004119
In the legislative context, a positive change occurred as early as in 2004 by harmonizing the sterilization conditions with international standards.
Recently, forced sterilizations have also been the subject of a Concluding Observation of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of March 2013120
, in which the Committee reproached the Slovak Republic for insufficient investigation of the practices of forced sterilizations and no compensation of the victims.
Both national experts and international organizations have been drawing attention to serious defects in the legal regulations on the sterilization procedures in the Slovak Republic, which had a special effect on the members of Roma minority.
International pressure against the Slovak Republic was based among other things also on obligations resulting to it from the ratified UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

of the advice for giving the informed consent to a sterilization procedure.
As to the request for the provision of remedies to the victims of forced sterilization, it is necessary to remark that Slovak courts either dismissed the actions of complainants or the awarded financial compensation to the victims was inadequate to the severity and irreversibility of infringement of victims' fundamental human rights.
In this respect it is necessary to point to several recent proposals leading to the availability of sterilizations for women from socially vulnerable environment.
In 2011, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic - the Unit for Socially Excluded Communities, presented a legislative plan on a draft bill on socially excluded communities122, for
In practice it would relate to free of charge contraception including the repayment of sterilizations for persons coming from socially excluded communities.
With respect to that such availability of not only contraception, but also sterilizations would directly affect in particular Roma women from socially disadvantaged environment, in practice suspicions of a new form of sterilization plan against Roma women may occur.
In 2012, the National Council of the Slovak Republic did not pass a draft bill on healthcare submitted by the opposition MP for the party SaS Lucia Nicholsonová124, in which sterilizations of women with more than four children or aged 35 years or more and having more than three children were to be fully paid from the public health insurance.
The draft bill followed up the current legal regulations on sterilization procedures and informed consent, whereas it expanded it with a condition of supervision in sterilization.
According to the draft bill, such supervision was to be ensured by a specialist and a witness, while the women had the right to choose the witness herself.
Within the regulations on informed consent to the sterilization procedure the draft bill relied on its provision in the national language and in the language of national minorities, too.

From the given perspective it would be more appropriate to neutrally make all modern forms of contraception, and not only sterilization, available to all women.
Judgments of European Court of Human Rights on sterilizations
In the periodfrom November 2011 up till now the European Court of Human Rights issued three judgments, which confirmed the illegality of sterilizations of Roma complainants in Slovakia and the violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter referred to as the "European Convention").
The first judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of unlawful sterilizations of Roma women in Slovakia was a judgment in the case of V.C. v Slovak Republic dated 8 November 2011.125 The complainant was a Roma woman who was sterilized in Prešov Hospital in 2000 during the delivery of her second child.
Immediately before the end of delivery via Caesarean section the medical personnel gave her an application for sterilization for signature to prevent that either she or the baby would die during further delivery.
Subsequently on 12th June 2012, the European Court of Human Rights decided similarly on a complaint of another Roma woman who was sterilized after the second delivery in Gelnica Hospital in 2001, whereas at the time of sterilization she was not major.
126 Even though in such case the Hospital needed consent from a representative for the sterilization of a girl, the Hospital had not asked it from her mother.

her a compensation of 48 000 SKK (i.e. approx. 1593 EUR), which, however, according to her legal representatives was not just satisfaction with respect to the irreversible and serious nature of intervention.
The Constitutional Court dismissed her appeal as apparently unsubstantiated.
They had not been informed of sterilization and they learnt of it only after it.
The third complainant was sterilized during delivery without giving informed consent, however, she died during the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights, and therefore the Court did not deal with her case.
In all three judgments, the European Court
The Court also awarded a compensation of non-proprietary damage to the complainants in an amount of 31 000 EUR, 25 000 EUR, 27 000 EUR and 28 500 EUR.
128 Specific measures aimed at eliminating such defects and safeguarding the harmony with international standards were introduced by adoption of Act on Healthcare in 2004, which became ef-

fective on 1 January 2005.
The ECHR also held that the information available was not sufficient to prove that the doctors had acted in bad faith when sterilising the applicant, or with the intention of ill-treating the applicant.
Similarly the Court stated that the objective evidence was not sufficiently strong in itself to convince the ECHR that the sterilization had been part of an organised policy or that the hospital staff's conduct had been intentionally racially motivated.
In addition, she could have initiated a criminal investigation, but she did not.
The Agent of the Government of the Slovak Republic before the European Court of Human Rights informs judges and prosecutors of the content of judgments also through educational activities.
Thus for national courts these Judgments present an important guide on how to proceed in examining actions for compensation of women affected by the malpractice with respect to the sterilization and in determining the amount of compensation.
A financial compensation awarded by the ECHR Judgments has been paid to particular applicants (V.C. and N.B.) through the MJ SR.
By judgment of 12 October 2011, the District Court ordered to the hospital in charge to apologize to the injured party, while in the letter of apology the hospital should admit the lack of authorization in interference with her personal integrity and permanent diminution of her human dignity.
However, the District Court rejected the remaining claims.
Additional proceedings run in the District Court Košice II., which satisfied the action by a judgment.
Based on appeal, in July 2012, the file was submitted for decision to the Appellate Court
The Centre welcomes the relevant ECHR Judgments which did not confirm serious accusations of organized policy in the sterilization of Roma women in Slovakia on grounds of their ethnic origin, which were brought by the applicant's legal representatives, which our country has to face internationally in the long term.
The Centre also notes that legislative changes with effect from 1 January 2005, harmonized the rights of patients with international standards.
The Centre believes that no cases will repeat in the future, which would cast a shadow on the Slovak Republic in the context of unlawful infringements of the reproductive rights of women, and especially of Roma women.
As far as the Slovak Republic has public interest in making particular methods of prevention against unwanted conception available to women with limited financial resources, legislative plans for such measures should apply generally to all women.
Recommendations
• Enhancing awareness in the field of reproductive health and planned parenthood.
• Enhancing awareness of Roma women on the reasons and consequences of sterilization procedures and on the content and legal consequences of giving informed consent to the procedure.
• Implementing the recommendations of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of 1 March 2013 related to the sterilizations of Roma women without their full and informed consent.

Demolition of Illegal Settlements
The issue of black structures was also dealt with in the Report on the Observance of Human Rights Including the Observance of the Principle of Equal Treatment for the Year 2011.
In the context of the situation and moods prevailing in the society with respect to illegal settlements, the issue Demolition of illegal settlements is contained also in this year's Report.
An enormous interest in this issue by the public was caused to a great extent by the tragic fire at Krásna Hôrka Castle and then news in the media.
After this incident, the Centre employees are meeting increasingly often with ideas supporting the demolition of all illegal settlements, including among the adult population and youth.
With respect to negative perception of decision-making activity of the court it seems to be adequate to them to demolish illegal settlements under pretence of waste removal.
But can all these settlements be considered waste?
However, it is not true that an illegal settlement must mean a file of waste.
Waste is defined in Act No. 223/2001 Coll. on Wastes and on amending and supplementing certain laws; the
definition is rather general and broad.
In many settlements the structures are firmly connected to the ground, and often there are brick houses with modified environment.
Many settlements built on the land of another started to appear several years or decades ago; at today they only expand.
The situation is similar also in the case of Krásnohorské Podhradie.
As to illegal settlements, it is necessary to point to several aspects.
The argument of the protection of property is used frequently.
It is necessary to realize that the ownership right of all owners has the same legal content and deserves the same protection.
132 It means that property means
Right to Own Property
lots of land on which black structures are built, and also such black structures and objects brought into the land.
therefore the Constitution protects also the property of persons living in illegal settlements, if it was acquired according to the valid system of law.
It is possible to demolish illegal structures only on the basis of a valid decision of building authority.
The court will solve problems of ownership rights for land and structures standing on the land, if the owners do not agree upon it.
Such decisions cannot be replaced by an argument of the removal of waste on someone's land.
Demolition of illegal structures, without the decision of the competent public body would be an infringement of the ownership rights of the owners of these structures.
At the same time, we cannot omit the protection of home guaranteed by the Constitution, Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms or other international instruments.
Art. 21 of the Constitution declares the inviolability of home, and it also defines cases when it can be entered without the resident's consent.
However, the owner of land where the home is built does not have such a right only on grounds of the ownership of land.
133 Ruling of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic PL.
ÚS 33/95 of 20.12.1995.
Disturbance of the Peace and Quiet in Krásnohorské Podhradie
The tensions that occurred in 2012 in the village of Krásnohorské Podhradie situated below the Krásna Hôrka Castle, affected the peaceful civil co-existence of the inhabitants with the Roma inhabitants of a settlement situated in its cadastre.
On the territory of present-day settlement the Roma started to build settlements in the 1980s, on the land of former brick factory owned by the state.
Most of the houses were built until 1971 and then the construction continued for several decades.
Many of structures which were built there today can be classified as the so-called black structures built without a building certificate.
According to the above stated facts the persons living in them are the owners of structures, regardless of that the ownership right to the land under them belongs to other citizens.
The original state-owned lots of land on which the structures were built were returned to citizens within restitution into tenancy in common, while their borders were not delimited.
Between 2006 and 2008, certain owners of the land requested the court in the form of claims to remedy the condition, but as they did not present the necessary documents, the problem has not been solved.
The situation in the village escalated in March 2012 with respect to fire at the Krásna Hôrka Castle, which on 10 March destroyed all roofs of this extremely valuable historic and cultural monument, as well as the interior of the upper Gothic palace including the collection of historical weapons which was situated there.
According to the investigation, the fire occurred due to careless handling of matches in lightening a cigarette by two minor boys from the Roma settlement, which resulted in a fire of the grass vegetation in the Castle hill.
Then the fire spread without control and hit the Castle.
Even though the sufficiency of fire preventive measures in the vicinity of the Castle was questioned, negative consequences caused by considerable damage to the Krásna Hôrka Castle were concentrated right against the
Roma minority living in the settlement in Krásnohorské Podhradie and caused an atmosphere of fear and hatred.
His decision was in full compliance with free exercise of ownership right to the real property, and the village had no title to intervene in it.
He also asked the Police Presidium of the SR and the Regional Directorate of the Police in Košice to ensure public order and protection of equipment which was to be used to demolish the structures.
Marián Kotleba was arrested and examined on suspicion of committing the preparation of offence of harm done to a thing of another pursuant to Article 245 of the Criminal Code and the preparation of offence of forcible entry into dwelling pursuant to Article 194 of the Criminal Code.
Since March 2012, the Centre has carefully monitored the events in the village of Krásnohorské Podhradie, and after the September meeting in order to monitor the compliance of human rights the Centre organized a personal survey in the village on 17 October 2012.
The survey focused on verifying the escalated situation between the Roma and Slovak inhabitants, which related to a threat of demolition of illegal structures in the Roma settlement.
On this occasion, women employees of the Centre negotiated with the Roma Mayor (Vajda) of the settlement Ľudovít Gunár who said that the owners of the relevant houses built without the building certificate on the land of another, wished to settle the lots of land and there were discussions held about possible purchase with land owners.
However, the Roma Mayor sees a problem in discussions that they are sabotaged by Marián Kotleba who according to Roma Mayor's words asked other co-owners to donate or sell their shares to exclude the Roma from the village.
He allegedly offered the lots of land to the Roma for sale for 20 EUR per square meter, which was a liquidating price with respect to the difficult social conditions in which the families from the settlement lived.
Moreover, the inhabitants of settlement submitted a project to the local authority, under which they applied for a grant from the European Union for the purchase of land situated under their real property.
Chapter 5.
Right to Own Property
Current Situation in Krásnohorské Podhradie
Efforts to settle ownership relations to the lots of land in the Roma settlement in the cadastre of Krásnohorské Podhradie, the purpose of which is to finally solve this issue and thus ensure peaceful co-existence of all inhabitants of the village, further continue.
This fact also proves that until December 2012, a total of ten applications for the purchase of municipal land under the structures in the Roma settlement were delivered to the village, whereas in all cases the applicants had settled liabilities to the village.
The problem of illegal structures in settlements cannot be solved without cooperation of all entities involved.
Also the owners of illegal structures must be interested in dealing with the issue, who must be motivated that if they live according to set rules, they will have an opportunity to improve their situation.
Hardly a solution can be made if it is natural for a man to build a home on the land of another without building certificate because he sees no other possibility.
Therefore it is necessary to come with an alternative which will be real.
Obviously, in dealing with this issue it will not be possible to find a uniform method of solution which would satisfy everyone, and it will be necessary to consider specific conditions of particular cases.
However, it is possible to solve the problem in a manner permitted by legal regulations.
If other black structures are built, it is necessary to intervene at the beginning and insist on strict compliance with laws.
Escalating the situation with various marches and appeals for cleaning certainly does not contribute to the solution of situation.
To deal with the issue of illegal settlements, it is necessary to act with responsibility and without emotions, just like the village of Krásnohorské Podhradie and many other municipalities.
In the context of the issue of illegal structures in Roma settlements, the Centre recommends:
• Strict controlling of the observance of the Building Act by building authorities.
• Dealing with the issue of illegal settlements in a comprehensive manner, not only in the context of the Building Act, but with respect to all aspects.
• Monitoring of the public order in the village and preventing the misuse of the right of assembly in order to promote extremist views and organize attempts for "cleaning" of land with illegal structures.
If it is necessary to demolish settlements, provide the persons concerned with adequate and suitable substitute housing.
Illegal Structures and Amendment of Building Act
The issue of structures built without the relevant building certificate is becoming an increasingly discussed topic, not to mention structures built on the land of another.
Practice shows that the current legal legislation is insufficient.
The removal of illegal structures is a considerably long process.
For many luxurious structures an additional certificate is issued, yet the threatening sanction of up to roughly 166 ths EUR (i.e. 5 mil. SKK) is not deterrent enough.
One of the amendments of the Building Act, which was to deal with the issue of black structures, was submitted in 2012 by the representatives of the political party in opposition, SDKÚ-DS.
The purpose of the proposed amendment was to fundamentally prevent the expansion of black structures and facilities on the land of another.
138 At the same time, the amendment should have speeded up the process of the removal of illegal structures.
According to the proposed text, if a structure is built on the land of another without the owner's consent, and the owner applied for the removal of such structure, the building authority is obliged to decide on the removal of structure within 30 days of delivery of application for the removal of structure.
If a person on whom the removal is imposed fails to remove the structure built without the building certificate or without written notice to the building authority within 30 days of the effect of decision, the building authority shall remove the structure at the owner or tenant's expense within 60 days of the enforceability of decision on the removal of structure.
The amendment should not apply to civil engineering structures.
139 Despite that the amendment was to relate to all black structures (civil engineering structures were to be excluded from the effect of the relevant amendment, therefore if they were a black structure, the law would not apply to them), many criticized just the fact that the whole amendment was anti-Roma.
This opinion also affected the selection of the place of a press conference where the sponsors submitted the amendment.
The presentation of the amendment of Act on black structures was organized by MPs in front of a Roma settlement, and clearly it was not a good choice.
Despite it, however, the amendment of Act did not contain a distinction of black structures.
The positive side of this amendment was that it was to allow fast intervention at the time when the structure only started.
Undoubtedly, it is necessary to deal with this issue as it is unimaginable that the state is not able to safeguard the protection
On the other hand, however, it is necessary to consider also the causes of the origination of illegal structures

Draft Bill on Registered Partnership
In the Slovak Republic, in 2012, debates started again on registered partnerships of homosexual couples, with respect to a draft bill of MPs in opposition for the party SaS144, whose purpose was to provide the institutionalization of the co-existence of same-sex persons, and thus provide legal protection to persons living in such relationship.
With respect to the debate regarding the proposed legislation, the public was discussing the issues of discrimination of homosexual couples and the violation of their rights by the present legal regulations, which only recognizes the matrimonial union of a man and woman as the only institutionalized form of the co-existence of two persons, and the family established by it.
144 The draft bill was presented to the September session to the Parliament by MPs Juraj Droba, Lucia Nicholsonová and Martin Poliačik.
In 2012, with respect to the presented draft, discussions about registered partnerships were more troublous also in the Parliament, in political debates and media presentations of certain MPs.
The representatives of LGBTI community were outraged in particular by statements of an MP for the party in opposition Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OĽaNO) Štefan Kuffa, who remarked with respect to homosexual people that He would be afraid to accept blood if he knew that the donor was a homosexual.
He commented on the law saying that "a small crying group will rape us".146 As early as in May 2012,
145 As a protest against the drafbill on registered partnerships, on 11 September 2012, i.e. on the day when the draft bill was to be discussed, six citizens' associations organized a demonstration in front of the building of the National Council of the Slovak Republic.
Another activity was an initiative “Something does not fit here (Niečo tu nepasuje)“, the purpose of which was to maintain the position of marriage as a unique union of a man and woman and as an ideal space for the raising of children.
Particular opponents pointed in particular to the Programme of the Slovak Government which enshrines consistent enforcement of the basic principle of Act on Family, under which marriage is a unique union between a man and woman and the role of society is to protect this union.
Chapter 6.
in a parliamentary plenary discussion the MP Kuffa declared that homosexuals were "sick" people who need help.
He declared that "The World Health Organisation had classed homosexuality as a mental disease once upon a time".147 He also added that "Letting sick people run around the streets and leaving them without assistance is a serious error" and that "We have to help them, we have psychologists, treatment centres".148 In October, during a parliamentary debate regarding the draft bill on registered partnerships he declared that homosexuality can be also good, it can sanctify a man if he struggles for his purity.
"Good homosexuality can be your Way of the Cross on the way of salvation".
As an argument against the Act he also said: "If someone is born blind or deaf, he is not responsible for it, we are not going to discriminate him for it, but he has limitations in life.
Homosexual orientation can be one of them".149 For TV JOJ he commented on the draft bill as follows: "It is law which would suppress human rights.
If you have an opinion other than prohomosexual, so I do not know, you would be prosecuted, by penalty, one-day imprisonment, just like we witness it in the West."
150 Then in the same spirit he presented his opinions on registered partnerships of homosexuals in an interview for the daily Plus jeden deň, as follows:
He cares for these homosexuals.
Does he treat homosexuals or what exactly is he doing?
What is dangerous about homosexuality?
It is dangerous that abroad the majority becomes victimized.

If someone had a lodging-house and refused accommodation for a black, would it be OK?
It has nothing to do with racial discrimination.
Adoptions are also equally dangerous.
We are still saying that two men and two women have rights.
But where are the rights of children?
Who asks the children whether they want to have two fathers or two mothers?"
Kuffa's party colleague, the leader of OĽaNO, and an MP from a party in opposition Igor Matovič, expressed his opinion on the topic, which was inflammatory for the representatives of homosexual communities and liberal public.
He reacted with respect to Kuffa's words in May 2012: "I personally consider homosexuality as a deviation from normal sexual behaviour, however, not an illness that can be cured."
152 During autumn debates on the draft bill he declared: "SaS submits something which is absolutely against nature.
You are satisfactory for people who say that they want to be a married couple, although they do not meet the parameters of marriage...
You think that you will cozen us ."
He also asked: "How would be the form be filled in then.
Where it the mother and father?
There would be parent 1 and parent 2.
Do we want to go this way?"
153 In a discussion programme of TV Markíza Na telo he expressed a disclaimer opinion on the issue of registered partnerships and called attempts for their introduction as trampling on the concept of marriage.
According to his words: "If we ape countries where such act is in force, then we will end like in Spain where in sexual education presents intercourse between two men as something normal."
151 They can be cured (31.10.2012; Plus jeden deň;

Since 1993, the Slovak Republic has been the State Party to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and therefore is obliged to perform its obligations arising therefrom.
The basic obligations by which the Slovak Republic is bound under the Convention is, inter alia, to secure effective protection of the rights and freedoms set forth by the Convention and also an obligation to respect and consider the judicial decisions of the ECHR in its national law and in the decision-making activities of the relevant national bodies.
Article 8 of the Convention regulates the right to respect private and family life.
According to the relevant Article, everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
The right to respect for private life contains several partial rights, in particular:
a) Right of self-determination, i.e.
to decide freely on oneself;
It results from judicial decisions of the ECHR that the right of self-determination comprises the right to determine ones own sexual orientation.
that this right comprises the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings, i.e. they did not specify this right only between same-sex persons.
As to obligations arising to the Slovak Republic out of its membership in the European Union, according to Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.
At the same time, according to Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, the European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.
These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between men and women prevail.
Pursuant to Article 12 par. 1 of the Constitution, people are free and equal in dignity and their rights.
Paragraph 2 of the cited provision safeguards the basic rights and liberties on the territory of the Slovak Republic to everyone regardless of sex, race, colour of skin,
Chapter 6.
Registered Partnerships
No one must be harmed, preferred, or discriminated against on these grounds.
Article 19 par. 2 of the Constitution safeguards the right to protection against unwarranted interference in private and family life.
The purpose of protection against unwarranted interference in private and family life is also conditioned by definition of term private life.
Also the Constitutional Court commented on this issue, according to which "private life" is a wide term and it cannot be defined in an exhaustive manner, and in particular it is not possible to limit it to the "intimate sphere", in which everyone can live their own personal life as their wish to, and completely exclude the outward world from this sphere.
According to the judicial decisions of the Constitutional Court, the protection of "family life" applies to the privacy of an individual in his family relations to other natural persons, which involves social, cultural and also moral or material relations.
Legal Background of Act on Registered Partnerships and International Obligations of Slovak Republic in this Area
The draft bill on registered partnership and on amending and supplementing certain laws regulated the possibility for same-sex couples of declaring a joint union before themselves and the society.
The text of draft bill itself defined the issues of origination and cessation of registered partnership, the rights and obligations of partners, the child support between partners
ÚS 17/1999, Judgment of 22 September 1999, Collection of judgments and resolutions of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic 1999.
ÚS 13/2000, Judgment of 10 July 2001, Collection of judgments and resolutions of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic 2001.
during and after the dissolution of partnership.
Since the draft bill also applies to the protection of childrens rights as a special group of population requiring special attention and protection, it was assessed also with emphasis on the protection and maintenance of the rights of children living with persons in such a permanent life union.
The proposed legal regulations should affect a total of 22 different legal regulations from the field of private and public law.
According to the draft bill, the rights and obligations of partners and partnership union as such should have the same character as the definition of rights and obligations of a married couple and marriage according to Act on Family.
In practice the legalization of registered partnerships would mean that registered partnership would be registered as the marital status in official documents, and partners would be considered as mutually close persons.
The legal recognition of registered partnerships would allow them to represent one another in common issues, inheritance in the first inheritance group, as well as the title to widow's or widower's pension.
The draft bill also regulated the exercise of parental right and obligations by partners, whereas it did not restrict the present right and obligations of parents.
Thus two new obligations would arise with respect to the child.
The first obligation is to care for a child for the other partner who is not the parent of the child.
The second obligation obliges both partners to jointly participate in the upbringing of the child.
The said obligations are in compliance with the provision of Article 41
of the Constitution, in particular with the constitutional requirement of the protection of parenthood and special protection of children and youth.
Such a legal act of the parent of child has undoubtedly a considerable effect on the live of minor child, similar with the effect of new concluded marriage of the parent of child or another significant change in the child's family relations.
Therefore for the protection of the rights of minor child, the Act on Family should be applied according to the proposed law, which defines that if conditions change, the court may change the decision on the exercise of parental right and obligations or agreement on the exercise of parental right and obligations, even without any application.
Thus the system of law of the Slovak Republic places a task to courts to examine whether the exercise of parental right and obligations in the case of a change of conditions, among which would be assuredly also contracting into a registered partnership, in the interest of the minor child.
The draft bill on registered partnerships created a new opportunity for same-sex persons with respect to an institutionalized form of ^ermanent_cohabitation^^^^_
Thus the draft presented an attempt for extension of the regulation of partnership cohabitation with a form which had not been contained in the Slovak system of law before.
Within the European Union and the judicial decisions of the ECHR, an opinion still prevails that the issues of regulation of possible marriages or other forms of institutionalized cohabitation of same-sex persons belong to the national powers of members' states.
159 For this reason the scope, intensity and time frame of legislative activities in this area depends only on individual will of each state as an independent subject of international law.
Any possible adoption of a similar draft bill in the future cannot be understood as a remedy of unlawful situation as a specific legal title to same-sex partnerships does not exist.
159 EU countries in which the possibility to conclude into registered partnership does not exist, but laws prohibit discrimination of homosexuals at least in the area of hiring include Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta.
The system of law of the following countries allows the possibility to conclude into registered partnerships or other forms of institutionalized cohabitation Ireland, Finland, Luxembourg, Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary, Austria and Slovenia, from among candidate countries- Croatia, from among countries close to EU- Switzerland.
The right to conclude into registered partnerships is enacted in the systems of law of Belgium, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Denmark and Sweden, from among candidate countries - Island, from among EEC- Norway.
The adoption of children by same-sex couples is permitted by laws in Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Spain and in the Great Britain (except Northern Ireland), from among candidate countries - Island, from among EEC countries- Norway.
The topic of marriages of non-heterosexual couples is current in France where the National Assembly adopted a draft bill allowing the conclusion of marriages to same-sex persons, and in April 2013 it should be voted in the Senate, whereas it is expected that from June 2013 the proposed legal regulation could enter into force.
The draft bill on registered partnership and on amending and supplementing certain laws, which was discussed and rejected in the National Council of the Slovak Republic in spring 2012, presented an attempt for legislative expansion of the present legal regulation on the level of law.
It is also necessary to say that even though the law was not adopted, its draft was in compliance with the Constitution and with international conventions on fundamental human rights and freedoms, by which the

Recommendations
7. Discrimination
The right to adequate working conditions and adequate remuneration for work done is guaranteed on the national level by the Constitution and the "execution laws" (in particular, the Labour Code), which create the title to claim the fundamental right as such.
Article 36 of the Constitution declares the right to just and satisfactory working conditions, in particular the right to adequate remuneration for work done.
This Article also contains the protection against arbitrary dismissal and discrimination, the protection of labour safety and the protection of health at work, the longest admissible working time, adequate rest after work, the shortest admissible period of paid leave, and the right to collective bargaining.
The right to just and satisfactory working conditions is linked to the presence of a labour relation and belongs to all its parties in the employee position (regardless of their nationality).
The international framework of the relevant legal regulations constitutes in particular of the provisions of Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Articles 28 Part II. of the Revised European Social Charter, and Article 31 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and other international treaties
within the system of the International Labour Organization and the World Health Organization.
The National Labour Inspectorate (hereinafter: the "NLI") in its statement163 for the Centre provided that in 2012, Labour Inspectorates had recorded a total of 1115 motions in the field of complaints of employees against employers with foreign capital participation, of which 720 related to the control of labour-law relations and 330 were justified.
Complaints focused mainly on the non-payment of salary, salary compensation, remuneration, non-payment of salary benefits, non-payment of minimum salary, failure to provide catering, travel reimbursement, bossing, continuous rest in a week, overtime work, unequal treatment, failure to provide legal requirements in the field of occupational health and safety.
According to the NLI statement, a positive shift was recorded with respect to the enforcement of human, working conditions and in the attitude towards employees by foreign investors carrying on business in Slovakia, whereas an improvement was reported in particular in foreign investors at whom a labour inspection took place.
On the other hand, however, according to a statement by Trade Union
Discrimination
KOVO (hereinafter: "OZ KOVO")164, in 2012, they did not report any positive step towards improvement in the observance of the fundamental human rights and freedoms of employees, but the economic crisis and reduction of corporate costs affected the acts of employers.
The most prominent should be the situation in the field of unequal remuneration between men and women where women have even by 25% lower salaries
Allegedly mobbing occurs on a regular basis by employers or managers with an emphasis on higher and better performance of the staff and subsequent degrading of human dignity.
In its Reports, the Centre has directed attention several times to the rights and working conditions of Slovak employees in companies of foreign investors based in Slovakia, which are not always in compliance with the system of law of the Sr and obligations arising out of international conventions.
The Centre recorded complaints also for cases of employee belittling.
Also in 2012, the staff of the Centre and its regional offices recorded motions from clients who had complained of the practices of foreign employers carrying on business in Slovakia.
Several cases of employee complaints were published in the media, and with some natural persons who wished to remain anonymous contacted the Centre; certain natural persons, however, dealt with the situation officially through the Centre.
Case Linora, s.r.o.
A marked interest of the media caused the situation at LINORA, s.r.o. Hencovce, with respect to personal inspections of female employees on the entry into WC.
members of OZ KOVO):
• Ladies WC is constantly locked and in front of it is standing a guard duty employee;
• On each entry into the WC, all female employees coming into contact with tights (ca 200 women) controlled in the form of a search of the person (by touching from the top to the bottom);
• Since the WC is locked, in the event of inspection of guarded facility by a woman guard duty employee, the employees do not get to WC for several minutes;
• The employees feel stress/ stress environment due to multiple everyday inspections as given above, which they find very degrading;
• The employer claims that the above personal monitoring serves as a prevention against theft (in the form of theft of new tights, the women employees allegedly undress old tights at the WC and dress new ones), which is supposed to have been committed by some of employees;
• A motion was filed to the Labour Inspectorate Prešov in the matter;
• A motion was filed also to the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR not only by women employees but also by the employer.
Within its competences, the Centre contacted:
The Labour Inspectorate Prešov which observed that a motion had been sent to them as early as in April 2012, and the case was in the phase of discussing the protocol with the employer;
LINORA which was contacted by the Centre over the phone to express
Chapter 7.
Discrimination
In this context, the employer was contacted via e-mail.
Finally the Centre called to the employer to consult the situation that occurred.
The employer's statements were very brief and concluded that they were not aware of any violations of fundamental human rights against the women employees.
Background
It was clear from the information available at that time that the search of the person can be considered an infringement of fundamental human rights, but it is necessary to provide that statutory exclusions exist which can be applied to this case:
In checks and inspections, regulations on the protection of personal liberty must be adhered to, and human dignity may not be degraded.
b) or also from the Act on the Provision of Services in the Area of Private Security Services and on amending and supplementing certain laws (Act on Private Security Services), according to which a person entrusted with the performance of physical protection or a search may carry out an intervention only if the interests protected by a security service are jeopardized or violated and only in accordance with law and other generally binding legal regulations.
At the same time, the employer must prove the expedience of such actions and the fact that the purpose cannot be achieved otherwise.
The Labour Code also provides the fact that the enforcement of rights and obligations resulting from labour-law relations must be in compliance with good morals, which definitely the employer's conduct was not.
According to the Anti-discrimination Act, from a certain perspective it could also be a form of harassment, whereas harassment is a conduct the result of which is or can be the creation of an intimidating, hostile, degrading, shameful, humiliating or offensive environment, and the purpose or effect of which is or could be violating the freedom or human dignity.
It was clear from the employer's conduct that after investigating all relevant facts (in particular, the unavailability of WC during the absence of woman guard duty, because it was locked), it was the violation of the fundamental human rights and freedoms, working on the Constitution in the part about the inviolability of a person and his/her privacy, and in part about the preservation of human dignity and personal honor, and the protection of good name.
With respect to the above facts, the Centre's priority interest was to meet the representatives of the applicant, women employees and also directly the employer, in order to consider the matter objectively within its statutory competences.
Proposed solutions which were provided by the Centre before the meeting:
1. If harassment is proved by good evidence by the employer towards the employees, on the basis of objective consideration and examination of the case by the Centre, the possibility exists that women
Chapter 7.
employees can refer the case to the court in the form of antidiscrimination action, whereas the Centre within its statutory competences is entitled to represent the employees before the court free of charge.
The employees may seek, inter alia, also the provision of monetary compensation of immaterial damage.
2. In the event of violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms, the employees have the right to bring a declaratory action to the court having subject-matter and local jurisdiction.
3. If the violation of their fundamental human rights and freedoms is proved, and all regular and remedial measures are exhausted, the employees have also the right to file a complaint to the Constitutional Court, and if the Constitutional Court grants the complaint and in its decision renders a statement, among other things, that the action violated rights and freedoms, and will cancel the action.
Then the Constitutional Court can prohibit continuing the violation of fundamental human rights and freedoms or human rights and fundamental freedoms arising out of an international treaty, or, if possible, order that the one, who violated rights or freedoms, reinstates the condition before violation.
In its decision by which it accepts the complaint the Constitutional Court can award a reasonable financial satisfaction to the one whose rights were violated.
Investigation of Surveyor Group
The Centre's employees personally visited the factory of Italian producer of tights in Hencovce, to verify the information with respect to possible violation of human rights in the form of search of particular women before their entry into WC.
The employer answered to the questions of Centre's employees from which the Centre learnt of the following facts:
3. It happened once that during an inspection the toilette was locked, but the employer allegedly apologized for it several times to the employees and stated that this fact would not occur again;
4. With respect to complaints of physical inspections, allegedly nobody had complained formally, until a meeting of the employer management and OZ KOVO;
5. The employer provided that they had no reports from theft as they attempted to deal with all by agreement on employment termination (he stated humanely) - only one woman employee confessed to theft and her husband brought 2 plastic bags full of stolen tights; the employer is also aware of the fact of sale of tights in the village by women employees;
6. Theft was discovered in particular on the basis of over-pressure in sewerage where old tights dropped into WC were washed up, which inflicted damage to the employer;
7. The employer expressed its opinion on the protocol of ongoing labour inspection on several pages;
12. The employer stated that the said inspections had been conducted only for the purpose of protecting its property against theft;
13. Inspections have been conducted on women employees for ca 1.5 year;
14. In any of intraplant rules or in a contract on security service the employer did not define what is understood as a protected area (it resulted from the above that physical inspections in the place are not defined according to Act on Security Services);
15. The Centre obtained information that with nobody of employees working for agreement outside employment the agreement would be terminated due its publication in the media as they worked as seasonal in the event of higher numbers of orders and there is lack of workforce in the region.
Agreement
In discussions with the employer, the Centre established the following outcomes:
1. The employer promised not to permanently lock the WC;
3. The employer promised not to conduct physical inspections exclusively by sight;
4. In the case of reasonable suspicion of theft or another crime or offence, the employer promised that in such cases the security service would comply with the Act on Security Services and the inspection would be carried out in closed premises (special cabins), in the event of any refusal of such inspection, the employer will contact the police;
5. The employer promised to harmonize intraplant regulations with the agreed form of inspections, and provide the same for inspection to the Centre upon preparation, or for cooperation after preparation (however, it has not occurred); and will also duly inform the employees of them;
6. The employer also promised to define a protected area in intraplant regulations so that inspections are conducted according to the Act on Security Services;
8. The employer will not terminate the agreement for any of employees with agreement outside employment, with respect to the publication of the causa.
She was satisfied with the outcomes, and she also expressed concerns about their compliance and possible sanctions.
The Centre was also allowed
to meet the woman employee whose agreement outside employment was allegedly terminated with respect to the publication.
The Centre informed this woman that the employer did not plan to terminate cooperation with her.
In addition, the Centre learnt of that this employee did not work in the packing department but in the sewing department, i.e. no inspections had been conducted on her.
None of women employees wished to be in the media, and directly the Centre did not ask to investigate the specific case.
Probably due to their concerns about the loss of job.
Opinion of Centre
The said case shows possible cooperation with the Centre and documents the possibility of the observance of the fundamental human rights by companies with foreign capital participation.
The Centre widely publicized this issue, in particular to prevent the occurrence of possible cases in the future, and to disclose information on the rights and obligations in the field of unequal treatment, applying a specific case.
On 15 May 2012, the Centre published information and on opinion on the case as follows:
The group performed an inspection at four branches of the company and directly on the spot verified real practices in physical inspections which these women had to take several times a day before entering the toilette in LINORA, s.r.o..
Therefore the lawyers demanded a demonstration of the personal inspection from the guard duty on the entry to toilette and personally acted as figurants in the reconstruction of human humiliation to get their personal experience.
They will use such obtained experience to professionally consider the complaint against the violation of human rights which occur in particular during personal inspections of roughly 200 women before each entry to toilette by touching or even impossibility to go to a locked toilette when the security service employee patrols another guarded zone.
The Centre considers absolutely inadmissible to practice a system in the company in which every woman is obliged to take a physical inspection if she wants to go to the toilette.
The procedure in front of the toilette door automatically provides information on who of women employees go to the toilette, how often in a day they go to the toilette, and how long she is there, although the security service claims that such information is not collected, and no overview or record of such information is prepared.
The employer immediately and before the eyes of the group remove the notice from the toilette door, according to which it was necessary to fulfil the condition before entering the toilette and take a personal inspection by touching.
The Centre reached significant progress that the security service would inspect women employees only visually and without harassment, whereas only in the case of suspicion of theft of a product, they will be allowed to conduct personal inspection, but only in a special cabin which will be reserved especially for such purpose.
The employer also undertook before the employees of the Centre to adopt an intraplant standard regulating rules according to the human rights, and shall inform the employees of the same.
In the interest of protecting the employees, the Centre also offered expert consultations to the company in the preparation of intraplant standard, to ensure efficient observance of human rights in the workplace according to the law, whereas the company accepted the offer.
In the future, the Centre will return back to the workplace to check how the company really performs the adopted measures in practice.
The Centre is ready to represent the LINORA, s.r.o. women employees in the court after filing an antidiscrimination action and help them seek the monetary compensation of immaterial damage.
The Centre stresses that personal inspections present a serious infringement of fundamental human rights and freedoms.

outstanding premiums.
The Insurance Agency reasoned it saying that they had no money for the court fee.
They attempted to collect outstanding premiums in the form of motions to commence execution.
However, according to a statement for the media, Social Insurance Agency in this matter performed its statutory obligations and paid long-term attention to it, the proof of which is that they have managed to recover a part of debts.
In this case the PDR called the Labour Inspectorate Prešov uncoordinated, which was twice in the factory for inspection.
The Police is supposed not to have acted in the case, too, which recorded four reports of the commission of a crime.
Three of them related to the non-payment of tax and premiums and one to the non-payment of salaries.
According to the PDR, not only the Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family Vranov nad Topľou failed in the case from among public authorities, which started to act at the initiative of employees.
"The Office provided employees with above standard services including advisory, extended office hours and preferential handling of applications."
Thus they had no impact on the position of company employees in the labour-law relation."

Fashion employees on the basis of 221 filed applications in the form of guarantee insurance benefits, on the basis of adjudicated bankruptcy (the bankruptcy had been initiated by OZ KOVO).
Also the Labour Inspectorate Prešov expressed its opinion on the causa, which declared in its official statement that "Having received an anonymous motion from a team of employees, they promptly started to conduct labour inspection.
The motion pointed to repeated non-payment of salaries, withholding of salaries and bonuses for the employees for March 2012.
The inspection was held between 30 May 2012 and 2 July 2012.
The labour inspection discovered that the employer had not paid the salaries due to controlled employees for the period from January to March 2012 and also that the employer had not paid the salaries to controlled employees for March and April 2012.
A protocol with specific violations of the law by the employer was prepared about the result of labour inspection, which ordered the elimination of ascertained defects.
Since the employer did not performed what was ordered to it, and in the meantime the Inspectorate recorded another motion of a woman employee, the so-called follow-up labour inspection started at the beginning of August.
The labour inspection was coordinated according to valid procedures.
Kika nábytok Slovensko
In 2012, the Centre was also contacted by a former employee of KIKA nábytok Slovensko, who stated that as an employee working in a shop he had not been allowed to sit down during the work, he had been allowed to drink only in the WC - but not often, whereby he declared that the employer had monitored the number of visits to WC.
For these reasons, as well as for reason of constant monitoring by the superior, he terminated the employment in the probationary period.
The former employee addressed his complaint to the superior, and also to a member of the company board of directors, however, without effect.
The former employee was willing to accept it.
According to an official statement of the company addressed to the Centre, however, all answers to Centre's questions were negative saying that everything is OK.
In this context, the Centre contacted the competent Labour Inspectorate just to obtain evidence in the case; however, the outcomes were in contradiction to the legal regulations in force (since there was a clear lack of interest to deal with the situation), nowadays there is a complaint lodged in the matter against the procedure of the Labour Inspectorate.
According to statements of Volkswagen Slovakia it is clear that the company has an incomputable amount of Internal regulations.

Conclusion
In the context of the economic crisis which continues further it is certain that employee dismissals will occur again, as well as increasingly worse conditions of employees.
With respect to the issue of the violation of the principle of equal treatment by employers and as a reaction to motions addressed to the Centre, which objected to the application of mobbing and bossing towards employees, the Centre:
1. Proposes that the obligation of the state to conduct the supervision of the observance of the principle of equal treatment in labour-law and similar relations be explicit and unquestionable.
3. Stresses again that it is necessary to continuously point to the said defects, not only among experts, but also through the mass-media and public civil discussions.
5. Also recommends adopting a measure under which employers would be obliged to prepare codes of ethics in their workplaces, establishments and manufacturing plants, and large establishments (above 20 employees) would be obliged to establish Ethics Committees.
6. Proposes prompt adoption of legislative measures to raise the competences of the relevant public administration bodies in the field of targeted dissolutions of companies without security to employees mainly with respect to the payment of salaries, as well as with respect to the payment of relevant payments.
7. Recommends intensifying the cooperation with NLI and its particular branches with the Centre in investigating motions complaining of the breach of labour regulations and the principle of equal treatment.
7.2 Protecting women from discrimination in chain pregnancy
In the period from January 2011 to May 2011 the Centre watched with interest the development of the situation and encouraged non-governmental organizations in the process that could be described as "struggle of non-governmental organizations with the Ministry of Labour, Social
Despite the fact that in the Slovak Republic from 2004 AntiDiscrimination Act is valid, which prohibits discrimination inter alia on grounds of sex (including pregnancy), gender and marital status, experience in relation to pregnant women was discriminatory in a long term and anti-discrimination act to protect pregnant women was practically inapplicable.
However, despite the positive changes in the law, the legislator "neglected" to modify the issues relating to women in chain pregnancy and the calculation of maternity leave, i.e. for women, which in the period of the first maternity leave shall conceive another child and are at a disadvantage compared with persons who, after the end of maternity leave, start to work.
The reason is that, despite the fact that pregnant women and mothers have to be specifically provided with enhanced protection.
e. reproduction of new citizens of our state and society, that must be not only satisfactory protected but even over-protected, namely in the interest of the future of our state and "not disappearing" of the Slovak nation.
In July 2012, the Centre was contacted by the client with a request to investigate a case of sex discrimination and the gender membership, unequal treatment in pay as well as breach of several statutory provisions and international conventions.
The employee draw the employer's attention to these facts, but it was not corrected to the date of referral to the Centre.
The Centre under the provisions of § 1 par. 5 of the Act. 308/1993 Coll. as amended appealed the employer and requested the opinion of the employer placing the present case of unequal treatment, as well as the answers to the questions below:
to undergo training and only next month will be assigned individual plan to which the commission is binding?
3. Is every employee, after the arrival from maternity or parental leave, deprived of the right to the same job for the same conditions, guaranteed by law?
4. Do the Employees who do not start maternity leave have to pass a prerequisite once every 2-3 years (which is the average duration of maternity leave) a period of training in 1 month, when they are not entitled to variable pay components?

Brief chronology of the case:
The client started to work on 1 September, 2007 in banking and finance for the job position Client's counsellor, functional area 1-Relationship Managers/Business Development, Qualification Group 3, Level B, the basic salary of SKK 19,000.
The client took the first maternity leave in May 2009, reaching a maximum assessment base for calculation of maternity leave pay, despite the fact that in November her income was significantly reduced due to incapacity to work.
It would also be in this case a direct discrimination on grounds of pregnancy and maternity, i.e. on the law specified reason, namely on the grounds of sex.
The employer should, in the opinion of the Centre as well as to the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic, used to determine the probable basis of assessment of current labour conditions agreed upon in the contract of employment applicable to the employee BEFORE taking maternity leave, due to which she is entitled to maternity pay.
Surrogate function of maternity pay implicitly governs the requirement to maximize introduction of real income under consideration, which seeks a pregnant woman due to her taking maternity leave.
In this case, the basis of assessment is composed also of variable components of
wages, because, under § 3 par. 1 point.
The question of determining the income, which the employee is losing due to her pregnancy and motherhood, who again becomes entitled to the maternity pay and its payment, is entirely at the discretion of the employer.
b) of the Anti-discrimination Act and avoid this area in conjunction with the facts of the case such an approach, which would be in relation to § 2a, par. 11 point.
Based on the presented facts that demonstrate the proper commitment, professional and financial growth of the client, there is no reason to believe that the client will reach, after taking maternity leave, lower pay and performance.
Probable assessment basis therefore cannot be determined in this case solely on the gross wages of the client, without variable salary, but the estimated - probable assessment basis, which client should achieve in the case of regular client business setting.
of salary would be paid to her.
Finally, it must be mentioned totally unacceptable, immoral and disgrace the way the client has been informed that her "motherhood was badly timed".
This situation is particularly unacceptable from an ethical as well as human terms, when specifically women as mothers should be supported by the state and society (which include not only family, but also the employer being the contribution taxpayer) in fulfilling their core mission-motherhood and parenthood.
The society has to provide to parenting not only its protection, but also the necessary care, especially material support of parents and the help in exercising parental rights and duties.

The case law of the EU Court of Justice declaring that Article 10 of Directive has so called vertical direct effect - i.e. individuals may be directly invoked before national courts.
The Court concluded that the scope of the principle of equal treatment for men and women cannot be confined only to the prohibition of discrimination based on the fact that the person is male or female.
Court of Justice has consistently recognized the legitimacy of protecting biological conditions of the women during pregnancy and motherhood and the introduction of measures to protect maternity as a means to achieve substantive equality of sex, as regards the principle of equal treatment.
• Article 8 paragraph 1 ILO
(International Labour
Organization) Convention No. 183 of 2000 on the revision of ILO Convention on Maternity Protection (Revised) of 1952 provides that it should be regarded as unlawful for an employer to cease employment of women who are pregnant, on leave under Article 4 or 5 and in the period after returning to work, that are determined by national laws and regulations, except for reasons not relating to pregnancy, childbirth and its consequences or breastfeeding.
The burden of proving that the reasons for dismissal are not related to pregnancy or childbirth and its consequences or breastfeeding rests on the employer.
And also, that woman is guaranteed the right to return after maternity leave for the same job or an equivalent job paid in the same amount.
International legislation status of pregnant women and their protection
Article 6 of the Basic Principles of the Labour Code provides that pregnant women, mothers until the ninth month after childbirth and breastfeeding women are provided with working conditions that protect the biological conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, baby care after birth and their special relationship with child after its birth.
Women and men are provided with working conditions that allow them to perform a social function in raising children and taking care of them.
provisions of the Labour Code.
Pregnant women and women who have just given birth thus were not provided sufficient peace that they will not be dismissed on probation because of their pregnancy or maternity.
Adjustment of other issues, resp. facts concerning the status of pregnant women and mothers to the ninth month of birth was in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Labour Code, the following:
In the event that this was a work, the performance of which would not require special regulation according to specific physical fitness or mental fitness, respectively, such a specific provision did not exist, the employer would not be entitled to require health information of natural person who applies for a job.
On the other hand, a person who applies for a job, is obliged to inform the employer of the facts that hinder the performance of work or they could cause harm to the employer.
In particular, the information which would impede the performance of work for medical reasons, for example if the employer takes an employee to hazardous work.
However, the Labour Code does not impose the woman to notify the employer of the pregnancy.
However, if a woman fails to notify the employer in writing of her pregnancy and does not produce medical certificate, she will not enjoy a special legal protection, for example as regards the adjustment of working conditions, working time.
Also, she will not apply the prohibition of dismissal in protection period.
Yet an employer is not required to provide time off with pay to visit antenatal courses.
However, the employer can provide such time off upon agreement.
If a pregnant woman and a woman or a man continuously caring for a child younger than 15 years asks for a part-time work or other suitable arrangement of the weekly working time, the employer is obliged to grant permission, unless precluded serious operational reasons.
A pregnant woman working at night may apply and the employer is obliged to ensure her to undergo assessment of medical fitness to work at night.
A pregnant woman may work overtime only with her consent.
Operational readiness can be only agreed with her.
The same is true when it comes to the woman or man constantly caring for a child younger than three years old, lonely man or woman who are continuously caring for a child younger than 15 years.
Mother, who works for the determined weekly working time, has the right to two half-hour breaks for breastfeeding for each child before the end of the sixth month of age and one half-hour break for breastfeeding in the next six months for one shift.
These breaks may be combined and provided at the beginning or end of the shift.
If she works part-time, but at least half of the weekly working time, has the right only to one half-hour break for breastfeeding, namely for each child until the end of the sixth month of age.
A pregnant woman should not be employed in works which, according to medical opinion, jeopardize her pregnancy for medical reasons related to her person.
This applies equally to the mother until the ninth month after childbirth and to the breastfeeding woman.
If a pregnant woman is doing work which is prohibited for pregnant women or by a medical expert opinion threatens her pregnancy, the employer must make temporary adjustments to working conditions.
If this is not possible, he reassigns her to another work upon agreement with her.
If it is not possible to reassign her to another suitable job, the employer is obliged to provide pregnant employee time off with pay.
Where a woman at work, to which she has been transferred without her fault, has lower earnings than in previous work, she is provided, to fill this gap, compensatory allowance during pregnancy and maternity under a special
The employer is also obliged to transfer a pregnant woman working at night to daytime work, if pregnant woman asks the reassignment.
If he cannot shift her to day work, the employer is obliged to give her time off with pay.
If the employer does not shift a pregnant woman to another job, although he was required, an employee has the right to refuse further performance of work.
It is a barrier to work for the employer within the meaning of § 142 of the Labour Code, in which the employee is entitled to substitute wages in the amount of average earnings.
The employee has the right to this substitute even if the employer has evidently no other work to shift her to it.
Notice given by employer: The employer must not give the employee immediate notice in protected period, namely when she is pregnant, with an employee on maternity leave, with a male or female employee on parental leave, with single parent caring for a child younger than three years.
Under these circumstances,
the notice would be valid.
If the notice is given on the ground of that the employer or his part is deleted or moved, the employee has the right, prior to the start of the notice, ask the employer to terminate employment by agreement.
The employer is obliged to comply with this application.
Immediate termination of employment by an employee - a pregnant woman or a mother to the end of ninth month after childbirth: a pregnant woman or a mother to the end of the ninth month after birth as any other employee may immediately terminate employment if:

A mother or a father will not have to take parental leave at the same time within three years of child's age, as it is the case currently, but they can divide it into five years.
Status of pregnant women and mothers within the end of the ninth month after childbirth is amended by amending the provisions of § 72 par.1, which reads as follows: "The employee and the employer in probation period may terminate the employment relationship in writing for any reason or no reason, if it is not stated otherwise.
Statement of reasons, excellence, duly substantiated grounds and written form are as substantive condition of validity of employment termination in probation period.
In accordance with the Art. 1 of the Act. 311/2011 Coll. of the Labour Code, individuals have the right to work and to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against arbitrary dismissal in accordance with the principle of equal treatment laid down in the field of employment in a separate law-specific anti-discrimination Act. The
Employers are obliged under the Art. 8 of the Labour Code take measures to protect the life and health of employees at work and are responsible under this Act for damages caused by an employee accidents at work or occupational disease.
Employees have the right to material security during periods of work incapacity, in old age and as for pregnancy and parenting on the basis of social security regulations.
Employees with disabilities are provided with working conditions that enable them to exercise and develop their ability to work with regard to their health status.
Employment relations at the time of the inability of staff to work for reasons of illness, injury, pregnancy or maternity and parenthood are increasingly protected by law.
Employers must not disadvantage and harm employees on grounds of the fact that employees exercise their rights under employment relations.
Under the provisions of § 13 par. 1 of the Labour Code, employers in
The exercise of rights and obligations arising from the employment relationship must be under the provisions of § 13 par.3 of the Labour Code in accordance with morality.
The employer is obliged to respond to the complaint without undue delay, rectify, refrain from such conduct and eliminate its consequences.
If the inclusion of the original work and the workplace is not possible, the employer is obliged
to assign them to another job relevant with the employment contract.
In connection with childbirth and caring for a newborn child, a woman shall be entitled to maternity leave of 34 weeks.
A single woman shall be entitled to maternity leave of 37 weeks and the woman who gave birth to two or more children concurrently, she shall be entitled to maternity leave of 43 weeks.
In connection with the care of a newborn child, a man also shall be entitled to parental leave from childbirth to the same extent, if caring for a newborn child.
In order to deepen the care of a child, an employer shall be obliged to provide a woman or a man on their request with parental leave until the day in which the child reaches three years of age.
In the event of a long-term bad health status of the child requiring special care, the employer shall be obliged to provide the woman and man who so requested with parental leave until the day in which the child
reaches six years of age.
In this case, the law specifically defines an amount, from which is calculated he amount of the allowance granted for maternity or parental leave.
For the probable daily assessment base would therefore in this case be considered height of the average daily earnings of salary showing the results obtained before the onset of the first maternity leave plus increase by the amount by which the annual base wage increases.
According to the Labour Code care of economically active women by its content leads mainly to the Law Institute of specific working conditions of women.
However, the Labour Code specifies the content framework of an employer's obligations in relation to women only marginally.
The provisions of the working conditions of women, respectively staff taking care of children (parents) are semantically divided into two groups:
a) specific working conditions of
women in general,
b) specific working conditions of
In accordance with the principle of equal treatment is unacceptable that the employer acted in breach of the Anti-Discrimination Act, which prohibits all forms of discrimination on grounds of marital status or sexual orientation.
Similarly is governed the protection of particularly sensitive risk groups (hence pregnant women) by all other international conventions and the case law of the EU Court of Justice, which, inter alia, states that the Article 10 of the Directive has so called vertical direct effect, i.e. individuals may be directly invoked before national courts.
this discriminatory condition.
The Centre therefore recommends:
Indeed, there is no legal reason why it should be an employee returning from maternity, respectively when embarking on a second maternity leave, deprived of the opportunity to claim the variable components of wages, since such a move the employer would directly discriminate against the employee and knowingly violated the provisions of the Labour Code relating to employee start to work after maternity respectively parental leave compared with the other employees.

Attitude of the Centre to temporary equalising measures
According to the opinion of the Centre expressed in the Report on Observance of Human Rights Including the Principle of Equal Treatment and the Rights of the Child in the Slovak Republic for the Year 2011, due to a lack of valid legislation, the fact that the bodies for adoption of provisions are exclusively state and local authority bodies, was repeatedly objected against.
Municipalities and higher territorial units fulfilling tasks delegated by the local authority bodies in the areas, did not have this competence.
As a result, the Centre proposed the adoption of a provision of a legislative character, that is to include the municipalities and hig her territorial uni ts among the subjects authorized to adopt temporary equalising measures.
In the year 2012, notwithstanding the legislative activity, the adoption of such an amendment to the AntiDiscrimination Act did not happen.
Chapter 8.
Temporary equalising measures
Temporary balancing measures
Adoption of temporary equalising measures presupposes that a marginalized group of population has suffered or suffers unequal treatment, while the task of the adopted temporary equalising measure is to remove or reduce caused discrimination and its consequences.
Recipients of temporary equalising measures, that is individual types of discriminated groups, were in the year 2012 in principle similar to the ones in the previous years.
It concerned persons/groups of persons without education, employment, who lost their home, persons with a physical or mental disability, elderly people, socially inadaptable persons.
However, it also concerns large families, lonely parents with children, as well as all those who are dependent on assistance and support from the society, either due to an illness, accident, loss of a breadwinner or they are not capable (work) of providing for their basic human needs themselves.
Temporary equalising measures aim to facilitate removal of found inequality in realization of the rights of these population groups in areas such as employment, education, healthcare and services.
The beginning of an origin of the need for adoption of temporary equalising measures is conditioned by prevalence and identification of unequal treatment, which eventually leads to a proposal and adoption of a temporary equalising measure.
The process of completion of the realization of a temporary equalising measure should start when (also by its contribution) unfavourable consequences of unequal treatment, alternatively unequal treatment per se, and its effects have been adequately compensated for, and if possible have ceased.
In concrete cases, by fulfilling the purpose, which was defined and accepted by an adoption of temporary equalising measure.
In the period since the commencement until the conclusion of realization of a temporary equalising measure, the state administration body, which has adopted a concrete temporary equalising measure, is obliged to monitor, assess and make it public.
The role of the monitoring and assessment activity of the responsible body in realization of a temporary equalising measure is to determine justness of its further continuance by means of summarizing its positive results, or on the contrary their lack or absence.
In relation to this, the Centre has a position of a recipient of reports concerning justness of existence of temporary equalising measures, provided the state administration bodies send them to it.
As in the previous terms, the Centre

The Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic
The Act regulates the purpose, scope, manner and conditions for a provision of grants in competence of the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic.
The Ministry may, in the respective budget year, provide grants from the state budget for these purposes specified in the section f) cultural activity of disabled persons or other handicapped groups of people.
In line with the respective Act, a grant programme for the support of temporary equalising measures - Culture of discriminated groups of the population.
In the year 2012, EUR 337,500 was divided within it and it represents a long-lasting and active tool for supporting temporary equalising measures, and which facilitates fulfilling cultural needs of marginalized groups of people.
According to the Ministry of Culture, the purpose of temporary equalising measures is to remove discrimination on grounds of health disability, age, gender inequality, economic and social discrimination, sexual orientation and so forth.
Their tool in the department of culture is a grant programme Culture of Handicapped Groups of Citizens, which aims at support of cultural rights of persons threatened by poverty and social exclusion.
Furthermore, it aims to support the principle of equal treatment, gender equality, non-discrimination, tolerance and intercultural dialogue.
The programme Culture of Disadvantaged Groups of the Population also supports cultural activities for people with different types of health disability.
These are persons with physical, mental, sight, hearing impairment, including protection of mental health and so forth.
The programme is divided into subsystems of support for: 1) live culture, 2) periodical press and 3) non-periodical press.
Even in the year 2013, the programme will be further broadened.
The Ministry of Culture realizes, in the scope of the grant programme, temporary equalising measures in the field of culture of children and youth living in marginalized Roma communities (in support of the process of social inclusion).
It regards the support of model projects, which provide for systematic work with children and youth directly in settlements, and which create an opportunity to integrate themselves and thus live a better life.
In this field, the Ministry has been cooperating on long-term basis with the Catholic Church in Lomnička.
The project Cultural and Spiritual Activities for Roma children and youth in Lomnička develops aesthetical, theatrical, artistic, musical sensibility and beside this social skills of children.
A different type is represented by the project Roma String on Wanderings CA Láčho Drom, Kokava nad Rimavicou, which strengthens musical talent of children from settlements, but also their own traditions and cultural identity, as well as ability to integrate more easily into society (the project also includes children and youth from majority population).
Both projects have been supported by the Ministry since the year 2006.
The aim is to assist children in forming their identity and self-realization, and also in searching for meaningfulness of life, as well as understanding, to support consciousness of their own dignity and to facilitate their full integration into life of the society.
Activities are monitored and assessed on yearly basis.
Mainly through the National Awareness-Raising Centre (it realized several seminars, involved senior citizens in numerous art competitions, festivals, awarded work of senior citizens, publicized the topic in department media and on a web page) and also trough a grant programme Culture of Disadvantaged Groups of People (13 events, predominantly interactive art workshops and festivals of seniors).
Events associated with the EYAA 2012 were also organized by the University Library, Slovak National Library, State Science Library (Košice, Prešov, Banská Bystrica), Slovak Library for the Blind of Matej Hrebenda in Levoča and so forth.
Activities in the spirit of EYAA 2012 and in the spirit of Europe 2020 will also continue in the following period.
Within support of temporary equalising measures aimed at integration of foreigners, multimedia events A Week of New Minorities Fusion, and also an electronic magazine multikulti. sk, creative workshops for the children of migrants, theatre for migrants Migoidy and so forth were supported through the subsidy programme Culture of Disadvantages Groups of the Population.
A number of events focusing on prevention of xenophobia, discrimination of foreigners and all forms of violence are carried out by organisations in the sphere of competence of the Ministry (the National Awareness-Raising Centre, Slovak National Gallery, Slovak National Museum - Museum of Jewish Culture, Museum of Slovak National Uprising, University Library, Film Institute, Theatre Institute, International House of Art for children - Bibiana and other).
Furthermore, its role is to motivate them to an active approach; to facilitate access to culture for disadvantaged groups of the population, and to help them fulfil their cultural needs.
The purpose is to provide the disadvantaged groups of the population with the access to information concerning fulfilling their cultural needs and equalize opportunities in the area of culture.
By helping the disadvantaged groups of the population via culture, risks of exclusion decrease and vulnerable groups of the population participate in the process of social inclusion.
It happens by means of cultural mechanisms and by means of facilitating information about disadvantaged groups in the direction of the majority society.
I t is important to support and create an appropriate legal, institutional and financial environment for the protection and development of the culture of disadvantaged groups of the population.
Thus, cultural mechanisms contribute to elimination of social differences, isolation and marginalization of disadvantaged groups of the population, and the conditions for the development of various information databases about the disadvantaged groups of the population and their cultural needs are created.
Furthermore, attention is paid to the need of intensifying cooperation in this specific field with state and local administrative bodies, which deal with the issue of cultural needs of the disadvantaged groups of the population with the purpose to gain information, exchange experience and coordinate support.
The issue of human rights is dealt with by 1 employee, who has it written in her particulars of employment.
tasks heading towards the support of temporary equalising measures are specified.
One employee is responsible for the agenda related to human and cultural rights.
By supporting cultural needs of disadvantaged groups of the population, obligations of the Department of Culture accruing from the international human and legal documents are fulfilled (e.
g. the International Convention For Protection of People with Disability, International Convention on Racial Discrimination, International
Convention of Discrimination of Women, the Joint Slovak-Hungarian Committee for Minority Affairs and so forth).
The Ministry of Culture defines priorities and results in the specific area also in cooperation with non-governmental organisations, which are members of the informal working group for culture of people with disability.
area of human rights also through its established organisations, the basic purpose of which is to develop cultural rights, creativity, tolerance, cultivation of ethic and aesthetic potential of all members of the society.
In the year 2012, it was a measure of the Slovak National Gallery concerning admission to its premises free of charge every first Sunday of a month for all age groups.
One of the organisations, which participates intensively in support of temporary equalising measures for persons with disability, is the Slovak Library for the Blind of Matej Hrebenda in Levoča (hereinafter referred to as the "SLB") operating as a publishing, library information and education centre for the blind and visually impaired.
In the year 2012, the library opened itself not only to people with visual impairment but also to users with a different type of disability, as well as to senior citizens.
These activities range from purchase of books concerning the respective topic, professional research papers in the respective field, to discussions, lectures, book exhibitions aimed at support of the culture of disadvantaged groups of the population, including a provision of reductions for the youth, disabled people and senior citizens and so forth.
An initiative aimed at support of temporary equalising measures in the area of the culture of marginalized Roma communities is carried out in the State Science Library in Prešov.
It concerns creating equal opportunities for people with disability and people threatened by poverty and social exclusion - migrants, senior citizens, homeless people, unemployed people, people from marginalized Roma communities, disadvantaged groups of women and so forth.
Personnel capacities for enforcing temporary equalising measures are not specially set apart.
The Ministry of Culture, in line with the resolution of the government of the SR No. 666 as of 8 August, 2007 in regards to the Concept of Safeguarding of Traditional Folk Culture, established the Coordination Centre of Traditional Folk Culture (by the Slovak Folk Art Collective).

The Coordination Centre of Traditional Folk Culture prepared a unique project of an electronic encyclopaedia with a title Traditional Folk Culture of Slovakia in Words and Pictures - it is placed on a web page www.ludovakultura.sk.
It represents a unique source of information easily available for educational and didactic purposes and for work with vulnerable groups.
In the year 2012, support for temporary equalising measures in the field of culture was published explicitly within the Call for proposal - Information for applicants applying for a grant concerning the subsidy programme Culture of Disadvantaged Groups of the Population.
171 In the year 2013, one of the priorities within the respective subsidy programme which is preferred, is the support of cultural activities in the area of non-formal education aimed at removing barriers in accessibility of culture for persons with disabilities.
The aim of this initiative is to increase informedness and awareness of the majority (personnel in the area of culture) concerning cultural rights of people with disability and as a final consequence accessibility of culture for vulnerable groups.
The instruments for support of temporary equalising measures are also articulated in the strategic documents of the Ministry of Culture.

By adoption of the Audiovisual Act, which came into effect on 1 January, 2008, a unilateral system of labelling audiovisual works, audio recordings of artistic performances, multimedia works and programmes or other components of programme services was established based on age appropriateness from the perspective of their inappropriateness or appropriateness for the age group of minors to 7, 12, 15 or 18 years.
In the year 2012, the Ministry of Culture held a meeting of the Minister of Culture with the representatives of publishing houses, where the issue of the second time curtain in broadcasting was considered (in interest of protection of children and youth).
The Ministry of Culture also cooperates intensively with non-governmental organisations focusing on support of the culture of disadvantaged groups of the population.
Since the year 2005, it has had an informal working group (out of representatives of non-governmental organisations), which solves questions of development of culture of citizens with disabilities.
Members of the working group have organized a working seminar (concerning the strategy of development and search of instruments for support of citizens with disabilities).
The working group has also carried out a survey of cultural needs of persons with disabilities, into which it has also included non-governmental organisations as well as organisations in the scope of action of the Ministry.
The guidebook provides information and recommendations on how to recognize and cope with various (information and physical, mental) barriers, which citizens with disability must face.
The material has been distributed to organisations in the scope of action of the Ministry and it is published on a web page of the Ministry.
As a matter of fact, it concerns those most threatened and most vulnerable.

g. by an act on Elimination of Poverty and Social Exclusion).
This is also aimed at mediation of the respective information to the majority and understanding the necessity that helping the weaker and more vulnerable is in its primary interest.
The Ministry of Culture realizes that by fulfilling cultural rights of disadvantaged groups of people, the society contributes to education to tolerance and fight against all forms of xenophobia, discrimination, racism, and thus moves the majority society towards respect of otherness, elimination of prejudices and stereotypes in relation to "the others".
The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic
Pursuant to the Competence Act, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Family is responsible for creating legislative conditions, which will guarantee the right to access in all areas of the sphere of action of the Ministry without discrimination and in line with the principle of equal treatment.
Within the preparation of proposals of generally binding legal provisions, the emphasis is put so that the proposed legislation does not violate the principle of equal treatment.
The institute of temporary equalising measures in utilized in Slovakia only rarely, mainly if temporary equalising measures are taken into consideration.
Some legislative provisions have a form of temporary equalising measures.
Character of temporary equalising measures have legislative provisions, e.
g. within the EYAA 2012.
The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR has for instance amended several benefits, which are realized through the national projects of the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic.
The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family through a managed organisation of the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family proceeded to or continued in the year 2012 in implementing of some projects, which have the nature of temporary equalising measures of non-legislative nature.
It regards for example the project aimed at support of the so called graduate practice, purpose of which is to temporarily support graduates up to 26 years of age in the labour market.
The project of graduate practice serves to support disadvantaged applicants in the labour market on the basis of age, since it is designed for young people under 26 years of age.
Institutionally, the project is provided by Offices of Labour, Social Affairs and Family.
From the point of view of its scope of material sphere of action in relation to temporary equalising measures, it is possible to state that the Social Development Fund under the managing authority for the Operational Programme Employment and Social Inclusion is an organisation established to provide assistance with removing poverty and eliminating a risk of social exclusion.
It supports development of projects, which create a path for inclusion into society to those who have been moved to its edge by poverty.
It concerns the unemployed, disabled, Roma, asylum seekers, homeless, women after maternity leave, pupils leaving schools prematurely, housewives or prisoners, who have just served their sentence.
Direct financial assistance is provided by the Social Development Fund to those projects, which increase opportunities of the weak and excluded groups to find employment through demand oriented projects.
173 Due to the already supported demand oriented projects and national projects through the ESF, as well as utilizing a considerable part of allocation of the programme, implementation of predominantly national projects is planned in the next period.
Temporary equalising measures
finalized.
The project will create prerequisites for development of a network of community centres for marginalized Roma communities (approx. 120 centres).
Financial resources for the project are allocated from the ESF.
It will concern activities aimed at social counselling, social rehabilitation, assistance with exercise of the rights and legally protected interests.
Furthermore, it will concern educational-preventative, educational and activation activity, mediating contact with the social environment, low-threshold programmes for children and youth, pre-school preparation, programmes of early care, interest activity and other activities.
At the beginning of the year 2012, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family commenced operation, through the Social Development Fund, of the National Project Field Social Work in Municipalities.
This represents continuation of the operation of field social work in municipalities realized through demand oriented projects, which are also realized within the OP Employment and Social Inclusion at present.
According to preliminary estimates, work performance of 860 field social workers and their assistants will be secured in at least 250 municipalities by the end of the year 2015.
Activities of field social workers will be performed for the benefit of almost 87,000 members of marginalized Roma communities.
The National project Field Social Work in Municipalities crucially alters and improves performance of field social work, it unloads municipalities from administrative work and it reduces costs for it.
The project consists of several activities and components.
In the period of the years 2010-2012, representative quantitative monitoring of the living conditions in Roma households in Slovakia (the area of housing, education, health, labour market, material deprivation and other areas)were carried out.
A qualitative in-depth survey of selected aspects of the standard of living in segregated and separated environment (incomes, expenses, groceries consumption) was also performed.
One of the realized components was also an analysis of the projects of the European Social Fund in the programming period 2007 - 2013 within the OP Employment and Social Inclusion and Assessment of its Impact on Marginalized Roma Communities.
Its purpose is to develop a complex database of municipalities with presence of marginalized Roma Communities, their infrastructure and availability of social and health services for this target group.
As part of the preparations of the new programming period 2014 - 2020, an independent investment priority aimed at promotion of integration of marginalized communities, such as for example Roma is proposed within the framework of the priority axis Support of Social Inclusion and Fight against Poverty.
Development of the Slovak Republic
The Ministry did not realize support of material equality of opportunities for members of disadvantaged groups of the population within the launch of concrete calls for submitting projects in the year 2012.
Nevertheless, within the framework of the Operational Programme Transport, in priority axes 1 Railway Infrastructure, 4 Infrastructure of Integrated Transport Systems and 6 Public Railway Transport, the projects contributing to the horizontal priority of the Operational Programme Transport "Equality of Opportunities" aim of which is, inter alia, to support elimination of discrimination on grounds of health disability are realized.
The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic
In the field of the state care for sport and youth, the Ministry sets tasks for IUVENTA - the Slovak Youth Institute via a contract.
IUVENTA - the Slovak Youth Institute is a state institution directly managed by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR.
Subsequently, these workers will organize youth camps with all expenses connected with the participation in the camp covered.
The emphasis will be put on integrating the young with a lack of opportunities into the programme activities.
The part of the activities is education of young leaders, which also aims at supporting and development of peer projects oriented at youth and integrating mainly disadvantaged or threatened groups of youth.
Moreover, IUVENTA also concentrates on youth lacking opportunities.
By this it is understood youth facing social, economic, health, educational, cultural or geographical obstacles.
The innovative project of Live Libraries represents space for the creation of a constructive dialogue with people who do not have an opportunity to meet and talk in real life.
The Live Libraries represent an instrument, which brings people closer, which respects human dignity and individuality, and which eliminates anti-social phenomena related to young people in the direction of excluded and threatened groups of the population.
In terms of long-term projects, IUVENTA cooperates with the Roma institute in realization and development of the programme Big BIS.
This programme utilizes the method of tutoring, also known from the programme Big Brother, Big Sister, which is based on participation of volunteers in individual development of a child.
The programme is supplemented by an element of intercultural and intergenerational dialogue, presupposing individual and personal involvement of volunteers from the ranks of university students.
That is, big friends, big girlfriends preparing for the profession of a pedagogue, a special pedagogue or a social worker.
The programme supports inclusion of excluded groups of youth and eliminates anti-social phenomena between the Roma and non-Roma youth.
The structured dialogue represents an instrument of the European Union, which safeguards transmission of voice from the citizens to the European level.
In 2012, IUVENTA safeguarded realization of the dialogue on topics of youth with migrant background, participation of youth and partnership with the countries of Eastern Europe and Caucasus.
The respondents could enter the consultation process either via IUVENTA's web page, which had a special banner "EXPRESS YOURSELF!" placed on the right side, or through a sent link referring to a public consultation.
On average, 150 representatives of young people and organisations working with youth voiced their opinions on every topic.
In every topic, measures or proposals for ensuring more open and inclusive society are investigated.
Vladimíra Antolová, PhD., the Influence of Media Communication on New Idols of Youth by Mgr. Norbert Vrabec - FMC UCM.
The community programme of the European Union Youth in Action is a grant programme for young people aged 13 to 30.
The National Agency of the programme of the EU Youth in Action (hereinafter referred to as the "NA"), based in IUVENTA since 2008, systematically fulfils the strategy of inclusion (integration) of young people with fewer opportunities into society, with the Roma minority being its priority target group.
The NA, within its education strategy, prepared a series of education trainings named "ROMMING" during the year 2012, aim of which was to increase informedness and project skill of active young Roma leaders.
One of the aims of the training was to emphasize the contribution of work with youth also in the field of promotion of human rights.
Another activity of the Programme is the European Voluntary Service, which enables young people with fewer opportunities to travel abroad for a certain period of time and to work voluntarily on a selected project.
Many of the accredited voluntary projects are oriented on exercise of human rights.
The Ministry performs the function of the authoritative body for the Operational Programme Education (thereinafter referred to as the "OPE").
The global aim of the OPE is to safeguard long-term competitiveness of the Slovak Republic through adaption of the education system to the needs of the knowledge society.
Through allowances from the resources of the European Social Fund, the OPE finances formation and support of human capital towards acquiring fundamental skills and key competences needed in the knowledge society.
Among the main aims of the OPE is to create and develop an effective system of further education and lifelong counselling focused on development of crucial competences and improving qualifications in accordance with current and perspective needs of the knowledge society, and to improve the educational level of persons with special educational needs with regard to the marginalized Roma communities.
The implementation of the OPE proceeds through the realization of the national and demand oriented projects.
instruments for undertaking school reforms.
It concerns complex projects resulting directly from the legislature, or alternatively from the conceptual documents.
The demand oriented projects are projects addressing the needs of target groups in a specific region.
They are carried out by means of calls for proposals for non-returnable financial contribution launched for a concrete measure, aims and activities.
The Ministry has delegated part of its scope of action to mediation bodies under the managing body, which is the Agency of the Ministry for Structural Funds (hereinafter referred to as the "ASFEU") and the Ministry of Health of the SR.
Within this axis, the ASFEU launched a call for proposal called "Active Ageing through Broadening Knowledge and Skills Which Improve the Quality of Senior Citizens' Life".
From the geographical point of view, it covered the territory of the Slovak Republic with an exception of the Bratislava Selfgoverning Region.
The projects from the abovementioned call for proposal are currently undergoing the approval process.
The call was aimed at increasing the educational level of members of the marginalized Roma communities through the support of projects focused on gaining practical skills.
It also concerned vocational education and preparation in a workplace for these communities by supporting preparation, development and innovation of pedagogical documentation, textbooks, methodological guides and didactic aids.
The aim was to facilitate the integration of members of the aggrieved communities in the system of education in relation to the Strategy of the Slovak Republic for Integration of Roma by the year 2020 and the Conception of Education of Roma children and Pupils Including Development of Secondary and University Education.
In 2012, the Ministry declared, within the scope of the provision 3.1 Increasing of the education level of members of the marginalized Roma communities, a written call for a national project with the title "Inclusive Model of Education at Pre-primary Stage of the School System".
The authorized applicant is the Methodology and Pedagogy Centre as a directly managed organisation of the Ministry.
On the basis of this, to build necessary competences for their entrance into the primary stage of education.
The national project will concentrate primarily on acquiring professional competences necessary for satisfying and developing specific educational needs of the children coming from these communities.
Furthermore, the aim is to create and implement the inclusive model of education at the pre-primary stage of the school system as a tool of inclusion
The project has been carried out since February 2013.
Within the scope of the EYAA 2012, a target group of senior citizens has been included in the calls for proposals from the structural funds of the EU for the year 2012.
It happened in connection with recommendations of the opening conference of the European year of active ageing and solidarity between the generations 2012 relating to life-long learning of elderly people.
The Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the SR for structural funds of the EU launched on 28 August, 2012 a call for proposal No. OPV-2012/2.1/03S0RO for submitting applications for non-returnable financial contribution with the title "Active Ageing Through Broadening Knowledge and Skills which Improve the Quality of Seniors' Life".
Within this call for proposal for submission of applications for non-returnable financial contribution the applicants could submit applications for non-returnable financial contribution from the European Social Fund within the OPE, priority axes 2.
Further education as an Instrument of Human Resources Development, provision 2.1 Support of Further Education.
The scope of assistance within the provision 2.1 for this call for proposal was allocated in the amount of EUR 5 mil.
The Centre has collected relevant information about the issue of temporary equalising measures, it has learned or has been informed about them.
It has also acquired the information from selected state administration bodies.
On the one hand, after the introduction of the temporary equalising measures there was certain
The adopted temporary equalising measures in individual departments were characteristic for their orientation either to legislative or non-legislative provisions.
Legislative provisions (changes of laws, or secondary provisions) in several cases fulfilled the character of temporary equalising measures only partially, mainly concerning their restricted duration - temporariness.
Nonlegislative provisions have mostly appeared in the form of various projects, campaigns, long-term (also those lasting for more years) campaigns, as well as shorter activities.
According to the character of specialization concerned with performing executive tasks by a specific state administrative body, it is possible to observe a more distinct orientation either to temporary equalising measures of legislative nature or to temporary equalising measures of non-legislative nature.
A specific level of implementation of a certain kind of temporary equalising measure is undoubtedly influenced also by priorities and positive or negative experiences of a competent body in their realization in the previous terms.
The combination of both forms of temporary equalising measures in a balanced proportion is utilized less frequently, even though temporary equalising measures in the form of changes of acts, or norms below the level of the acts, to which temporary equalising measures of non-legislative nature could relate with an aim and purpose seem to be perspective.
It is the connection of temporary equalising measures of both groups, which could lessen their negatives and strengthen their positives.
Consequently, the Centre still considers the support of broadening, improving quality and innovative approach to temporary equalising measures to be its significant aim in the area of creating tolerant, harmonious and participating society also in the field of exercising the principle of equal treatment.
Mainly, in the form of counselling activity, consultations, issuing professional statements and realization of professional seminars and trainings of state bodies, and in the year 2013 also local administration bodies.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of the Slovak Republic states, while taking into consideration existing inequality in the Slovak society governed by prevailing stereotypes in judging marginalized groups, that it is very illusory to count with elimination of inequality and safeguarding complete equality of opportunities.
It is more a task of gradual reduction and elimination of manifestations of unequal treatment in the society.
Protection of human rights is a fundamental precondition of cohesion of the society and its sustainability.
Due to this reason, provisions are realized, aim of which is to prevent a formation of permanent restrictions or a risk of excluding any groups of the population from fully-fledged participation in the social life.
In order to improve the aforementioned situation the Centre recommends:
• To pay more attention to continuous, but also subsequent monitoring and assessment of realization of temporary equalising measures as to their effectiveness, scope, extent and mutual complementation.
• To constantly look for an effective proportion between elimination or alleviation of caused discrimination and its consequences (in the past), and a solution of the current needs (in the present), with a clear and specified view of the future development and prevention.
• To develop the strategy of temporary equalising measures from complex and sectional documents, which are mapping, assessing and finally solving the situation of the disadvantaged and marginalized groups of the population.
9. The right to trial without unreasonable delay in court proceedings
The European Court for Human Rights
In relation to disputes conducted before the ECHR, a total of 23 judgements were delivered in the year 2012 against the Slovak Republic.
In nearly half of these judgements, in 10 cases out of the total number of 23 cases exactly, violation of the right to trial without unreasonable delay was found.
The total amount of indemnification in cases of violation of the right to trial without unreasonable delay represented EUR 132,715.
The highest indemnification was awarded on the basis of settlement proceeding by a decision in the case of Mati and others versus the Slovak Republic174, which represented a total amount of EUR 30,000, i.
e. EUR 6,000 per one claimant.
In 22 cases, the ECHR sent the government of the Slovak Republic proposals of declarations for reconciliation together with a notification, and in 19 cases on the basis of an agreement of the government settlement
Chapter 9.
The right to trial without unreasonable delay in court proceedings
In a preliminary resolution issued in connection with this problem, the Court stressed predominantly numerous organisational reforms taking place from 2007 to 2010, as well as two changes in Civil Procedure Code, which became effective in the years 2007 and 2008.
It has warned that after the average length of civil and legal proceedings was constantly increasing, especially from the years 2002 to 2004, it started to decrease on a regular basis after the year 2004.
In 2004, it represented 17.56 months, in 2011 it was 11.35 months.
In relation to a problem associated with the fact that in some cases delays in proceeding occur notwithstanding a previous directive of the Constitutional Court to deal with the matter, on the international level, and not only on the part of the Committee of the Ministers of the Council of Europe, the system of decisions implementation control was highly acclaimed through a project of the Constitutional Court, which will continue.
Constitutional Court of the Slovak republic
1 of the Convention objected in 14,957 complaints altogether and the right to judicial and other legal protection under Art. 46 Sect.
1 of the Constitution
objected in 14, 844 complaints.
The Constitutional Court realizes a project "Effectiveness of the Execution of the Decisions of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic in the Proceedings on the Complaints by Natural Persons and Legal Entities (Specific Control of Constitutionality) in Causal Link with the Principle of Presumption of the State's Fault (Courts of general jurisdiction and law enforcement authorities)".
The Public Defender of Rights
In the year 2012, 36 cases of violation of the fundamental right to trial without unreasonable delay in court proceedings were found on the part of the Public Defender of Rights.
The Centre deals with this professional matter exclusively in the Report on the right to trial without unreasonable delay in court proceedings in the Slovak Republic.
The situation was no different in the year 2012, which had its particularities, but at the same time, it brought with it the legacy of the previous periods.
In the area of inadequate promptness of court proceedings, the problem relating to the activity of court expert witnesses and expert witnessing per se has not been solved yet, even though the problem primarily lies in the area of the personnel.
Technological and professional development of human society is constantly accelerating, a volume of information and human knowledge is increasing in a geometrical progression.
Then, the number of situations in which a court is not able to find a needed expert witness in his/her local sphere of activity and finally the expert witness who is found despite proclaimed active operation has his expert witness activity suspended, should decrease.
A professional expert refuses to deliver expert evidence because of being extremely busy, or he/she will not be able to deliver expert evidence because it will relate to such a specific subfield of his/her specialisation in which he/she does not have specialized knowledge.
Then, a delivered expert evidence will not serve its purpose and it will lead to repeated expert evidence searching.
The continuous problem is represented by reserves in the activity of courts and judges, in their organization of work, in quality management of their activity, as well as in creation of appropriate working conditions.
These problems repeat incessantly in an increased volume at the same courts, which are based primarily, in county towns, whereas their ranking is influenced by intensity of social and economic processes in the sphere of action of specific courts.
In 2012, the Centre also registered positive activities of central state administrative bodies in this field and their determination to solve the problem.
Considering the fact that the phenomenon of court delays represents a chronic and deep-rooted problem, its solution should not be and is not possible to realize successfully in a fraction of period, in which the problem arose.
Similarly as in the previous last years, also in the year 2012 such factors appeared, which compared to length of occurrence of unnecessary delays can be designated as temporary but with effects of several years.
In the past, it applied to court cases in matters of liability from voucher privatisation and their subsequent executions, bankruptcy proceedings of non-banking companies, court proceedings related to changes in social legislature, exaction of concessionary fees.
In this respect the Centre recommends:
• To amend, alternatively reconstitute an activity of experts on a legal and executive level.
• To consensually realize a national conception of activity of jurisdiction in the Slovak Republic at least in fundamental points lasting over the period of several electoral terms, in order to prevent regularly reoccurring optimizations, reoptimizations, re-reoptimizations of the Slovak jurisdiction in short time intervals.
• To pay increased attention to effectiveness of labour, organisation and preliminary internal and external control of courts, especially those, which appear on prominent places in statistics concerning violation of the fundamental right to trial without unreasonable delays regularly and in the long term.
• To design a methodology of coordinated determination, search and solving crisis situations, when monothematic applications from a relatively small circle of legal subjects in thousands or ten thousands regularly congest the jurisdiction of the Slovak Republic, with an emphasis on legal, organisational, material and personnel side, in a way that fundamental rights and freedoms of all participants of court proceedings, including the fundamental right on public hearing of a matter without unreasonable delay, were influenced the least.
10. The Rights of the Child
Overall failurce of the state system in protection of children
A syndrome of a maltreated, abused and neglected child is in Anglo-Saxon literature referred to as CAN - Child Abuse and Neglect.
This term includes not only active forms of abuse, but also different passive forms.
According to a different definition, battering, abuse and neglect of a child is considered to be any non-accidental, intentional (or unintentional) act of a parent or other person against a child unacceptable or refused in a given society, damaging physical, psychological and social state and development of a child, eventually also causing his/her death (Dunovský et al., 1995)182.
Violence against children
Approximately one third of six billion people in the world is represented by children.
According to the findings of UNICEF, about 56 million children report an exposure to violent or aggressive behaviour in their families.
16 per cent of the children encounter hitting in their families.
According to statistics, physical violence at home is highest in Central Europe, reported by 21 per cent of the children.
Unofficial estimates mention one to two per cent.
The European Union criticizes Slovakia for not performing surveys concerning child abuse.
The survey, carried out in Slovakia in 1999 on a sample of 5,230 children aged from 15 to 16 by Slonad association, showed that one quarter of the children had experienced physical violence from parents - such as beating, kicking or cutting.
More than 12 per cent of the children said they had been victims of sexual abuse, with the abuser being a close person or a relative.
One third of the abused said that the experience still haunts them, one third said they had not confided in anyone.
It is estimated that two thirds of the victims are children younger than three years of age.
Due to the fact that an alarmingly long time has passed since the last official survey, it is necessary to introduce an obligation to perform surveys concerning child abuse on a regular, yearly basis.
Experts warn that psychological trauma inflicted upon an abused child lasts for many years, sometimes even through whole life.
Chapter 10.
The Rights of the Child
It is necessary to inform the broad public about the problem of child abuse and to increase public awareness concerning the duty to report every suspicion of child abuse and neglect (for example to call Crisis Helpline).
Anyone may call the lines assisting abused children anonymously and report - a neighbour, teacher or relative.
The case will be investigated by the personnel themselves.
A system of abused childcare exists in Slovakia, at which state and nonstate institutions cooperate.
A child can report a case himself/herself, or it can be a person who has a suspicion, that development of a child is from some reason threatened.
In acute cases, children are placed in the "Centre for Abused Children".
This institution serves children who need special care and immediate help.
It concerns predominantly mentally and physically abused children, or children abused sexually by their parents, or other persons.
An immediate contact with a child per se as well as with the situation, in which the child is, has mainly the Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family.
In relation to children, Local Offices of Labour, Social Affairs and Family operate in the section of state social benefits, social help, counselling and psychological services and in the section of social and legal protection of children and social custody.
However, third parties, including legal entities, bodies and institutions having information about social environment of a child and potential threats to a minor child, may also refer to the Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family.
In 2012, the public was outraged by death of a minor Lucka who had been battered to death years ago in Bratislava and whose remains had been hidden by her stepfather in a flat.
In spite of warnings of people from the vicinity, the Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family had not taken any action.
The result of this inactivity was a discovery of the dead girl, who had been lying murdered in the flat and was not missed by anybody for the whole 3 years.
The fact that the girl was supposed to attend school for two years already, but the authorities did evidently not mind, is what is the most outrageous on the whole case.
According to opinion evidence of neighbours, they had contacted the police on manifold occasions due to night-time noise disturbance and also because they had heard crying, shouting of little Lucka, who had been beaten and abused.
The police and social guardianship have completely failed in this case since they have taken no interest in the case and in spite of filed reports they have stayed passive and have not even gone to examine the situation.
What is shocking, is that no one had noticed this fact.
For instance, the personnel in a kindergarten had not taken any notice of the fact that Lucka had been absent all of a sudden, or they had not noticed initial symptoms (at this time, battered Lucka was 2 years old, but pursuant to the law a 5 year-old child must attend 1st preschool year in the kindergarten).
Even the family, relatives or neighbours had not asked where the little girl had suddenly disappeared.
Failure of social guardianship and the police
However, no one had taken any action.
The state police have failed in this case as well.
Even though they had intervened in the flat twice due to reported night-time noise disturbance, each time it was concluded by "persuasion".
Neither the smell of the decomposing dead body of the victim coming from the flat, nor disorder which was to be seen from the corner of the front door did not force them to go inside even though they are entitled to do so.
Another in the series of negligence in this case is the fact that the parents were receiving child benefits after her death as well.
The Central Office has explained absurdity of this case by claiming that a parent must provide a written evidence of child benefit entitlement only after a child starts compulsory school attendance.
Nevertheless, Lucka, who would have been eight today, had not managed to start school.
The parents of the girl, Alexandra H. and Juraj H., had either provided the Office with false evidence, or competent employees had not fulfilled their duty and had not verified whether the married couple really had the right to claim the child benefit.
Failure of School System and Local Government
Nevertheless, Lucka did not even start school.
However, the Labour Office did not obtain such a notice, which is another proof of a lack of cooperation and mutual interconnectedness of the state administration bodies.
After reaching six years of age, apart from granted exceptions, a child is obliged to attend school.
Primary schools are under the authority of municipalities, which are their providers.
Therefore, according to a domicile (which she definitely had in a flat on Kocel Street in Bratislava since benefits were being sent there on regular basis) Lucka should have been enrolled at some educational institution in Bratislava city district Ružinov.
"If a parent does not register a child at a school and we learn about it, it is treated as a minor offence", said a spokesperson of Ružinov Miroslava Štrosová.
However, she admitted, that local officials do not really investigate whether a parent has fulfilled his/her legal obligation or not.
Failure of Healthcare and Insurance System
At the same time, the girl must have been registered with a doctor.
A doctor must have invited the child for compulsory examinations or vaccination, doctor was receiving monthly payments on her from an insurance company.
Up to 60 days following birth, which exceeds a 28-day term of medical certificate necessary for claiming the benefit, it is required by the law to register a child in an insurance company.
Nevertheless, no one controls whether all parents really fulfil this obligation.
"We do not have any reason to investigate whether some child has or has not been registered in the system of health insurance.
After all, three insurance companies operate here, if they are not registered with us, they can be registered with some other company", said a spokesperson of Všeobecná zdravotná poisťovňa Dana Gašparíková in accordance with the rules of the insurance market.
Contrary to this, the system of one insurance company could, from this point of view, be substituted only by such a pluralistic system of insurance companies, which would inevitably require a uniform and complete insurance stock in Slovakia.
The stock would, paradoxically and improbably, be shared mutually by the competitors in commercial environment.
Pursuant to the law, it is thus possible for a minor child up to 6 years of age to simply disappear, since the state does not require any evidence of existence of a child until the age of compulsory school attendance.
A gap in the protection system permits disappearance of a child.
Moreover, it is true that minor children from 0 to 6 years of age are naturally the most vulnerable, helpless and the most discriminated human beings.
Infringement of tenant law helped discover an infringement on the right to life
The fact that the parents of the battered girl lived in the flat illegitimately is only the icing on the cake in this tragically infamous case, which shows how the whole state, social and protection system in Slovakia has failed.
As a matter of fact, the police broke into the flat absurdly and incidentally only after an arrest warrant had been issued for the parents of the little girl due to their illegitimate use of the flat.
Alexandra and Juraj had, de facto, been using the flat owned by Vladimír I. unlawfully.
They had not paid rent and they had "maintained" the rented premises in a desolate state.
At that time, another child was born to the parents Saška, who had been raised alongside her dead sister.
Fortunately, the girl ended up in hands of doctors, from where she has been taken into care of social workers.
Private law revealed shortcomings of public law in Slovakia.
Inaccuracy of the justice system
The abuser Juraj, who was allegedly venting his anger on his own daughter Saška, had previously been sentenced for battering his wife, and last year the court assessed him another 6 months for illegitimate usage of the flat, where he lived.
When he was sentenced in 2008 for dangerous threatening, the court did not order probation supervision.
The victim of his behaviour, which the police started to investigate as battering of a close person, was then his wife.
Her daughter Lucia (15) was at that time still alive.
According to preliminary information from the police, she died approximately a year and a half after Juraj H. battered her.
In July 2009, Juraj was released from prison in Leopoldov, where he served his sentence of imprisonment for battering.
Not after a month after Juraj's return from prison, Alexandra had to be hospitalized.
If the step-father had been under the probation supervision, a judge could have been informed about domestic violence and he could have taken some action.
Domestic violence is, generally speaking, committed under the influence of alcohol and that is why prohibition to drink alcoholic drinks is a part of probation supervision (in this case, the accused was at the decisive time under the influence of drugs, which he admitted).
Juraj H., however, was never ordered probation supervision.
In the event of discovery that a sentenced person violates ordered obligations and restrictions, a competent judge is informed about these circumstances in the form of preliminary report from probation, and he/she may immediately act with a purpose of eliminating a present unwanted state.
A judge may, for instance, change a conditional sentence to an unconditional one.
The case of the abused minor Lucka, who was found by the police three years after her death in the flat in the capital city of the Slovak republic, uncovers gross shortcomings of the complete state system.
The cause clearly points not only to individual shortcomings of several employees of the Social Office, but also to overall failure of the whole system of state institutions, which could have taken operative action and could have saved Lucia's life.
Case of abused 2-year-old Lukáško
Less than six months after the discovery of a three-year-old dead body of Lucka in a flat in Bratislava, a twoyear-old Lukáš was taken to Children's Faculty Hospital in Bratislava.
He had a number of hematoma and marks on his hands, which can be a proof of cigarettes burns.
According to the media (TV Markíza), Lukáš was being hurt by his father, with whom he lived in a flat in Petržalka.
His grandfather, who lives in the house as well, saved him from the flat because he had heard the boy crying constantly.
The police have detained the 21-year-old man, who faces charges of battering
On the whole, the system of protection and prevention of violence against children has not been set up yet.
On the basis of these events, which have outraged whole of Slovakia, the first ever state survey on violence against children will be performed.
It is being prepared by the Institute for Labour and Family Research in cooperation with the non-governmental organisations dealing with problems of child abuse.
The survey among 1,500 children in the eighth and ninth grade of elementary school, is supposed to be safeguarded by the Research Institute of Child Psychology and Pathopsychology.
If parents failed to attend them with children, doctors would be obliged to inform the Social Office.
Department of Labour and Ministry of Health are discussing the measure supposed to identify battering of the youngest children early in the beginning.
The Parliament has recorded a proposal for the introduction of compulsory health check-ups of children by 7 years of age under a threat of a sanction for parents in a form of losing children benefits.
In the year 1989, the UN adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which integrates all four categories of human rights: civil, political, social and cultural.
The Convention was ratified by the Federal Assembly of the former Czechoslovakia in the year 1991.
The Rights of the Child
On the whole, they all aim at protection of the child and his/her rights, protection from exploitation, abuse, full recognition of legal subjectivity of the child, as well as the need to provide for/create all conditions in order to secure fully-fledged life and complex development of mental and physical capacities of the child.
In contrast to the first two documents, which are less declarative in their character, the Convention on the Rights of the Child binds the signatory states, among them also Slovakia, to implement its fundamental concepts and needs into its legal order/legislation and to regularly inform the international community on performance of adopted obligations.
The core principle of this Convention is the principle of the best interest of the child, respecting his/her individuality, dignity and needs.
The Article 41 of the Constitution specifies a constitutional frame of the rights immediately pertaining to children.
By definition, all human rights and basic liberties are guaranteed to everyone regardless of age or other qualities, thus to children as well.
Human life is worthy of protection even prior to birth".
The primary source of law regarding protection of children on the national level is the Act on Family.
On the basis of the abovementioned, it is possible to observe that the Slovak legal system prioritizes protection of a family unit as a whole, the role of which is to care, raise and protect minor children.
Pursuant to the Act on Family, parental rights and obligations include systematic and rigorous care of a minor's upbringing, health, nutrition and complex development, his/her representation and management of a minor's property.
In consideration of the legal wording, it is thus possible to claim that a parent of a child has not only the right to care for a child, but also an obligation to care for a child.
Similarly, failure to perform obligations in relation to the child is also punishable.
On the other hand, hindering the exercise of parental rights is legally sanctionable, and thus a parent may demand his right to childcare (some of its components).
Support of family and parenting in interest of needs of children is also stipulated in the regulations falling within
The Slovak republic, besides the means of legislative protection, provides its citizens with material help in the form of various allowance payments and benefits provided by the state.
Interests and a specific status of children are protected in a preventive way (and consequently also in a repressive way) in the provisions of criminal law.
Protection of children is generally stated in these provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, pursuant to which a criminal offence is punished more severely if committed on a child or a pregnant woman.
The special status of children in the Slovak legislative system is also represented by the provisions of the Act on Civil Procedures establishing conditions under which it is possible to claim rights and justifiable interests by means of a civil judicial proceeding.
In the Slovak republic, the court procedural process is set in such a way as to remove crucial impediments in court for juristic persons183 in exercising their rights in order to promote the interest of children themselves before interests of their parents, which can be mutually contradicting (not only between parents, but also among parents and children).
The Centre deals with this professional issue in an extensive Report on the Rights of a Child in the Slovak Republic.
A loophole in the protection system does enable disappearance of a child.
Moreover, it holds that minor children from 0 to 6 years of age are naturally the most vulnerable, helpless and most discriminated human beings.
Due to a lack of integrated evidence, a lack of state supervision and a lack of state control of these human beings, minor children aged 0-6 are exposed to a risk of violence the most in Slovakia.
Paradoxically, the most vulnerable, helpless and the most discriminated human beings are protected the least against direct violence, cases of abduction or trafficking for prostitution or pornography, human organs trafficking or sale for slavery.
The Ministry of Interior of the Slovak republic maintains a register of population REGOB created in cooperation with towns and municipalities.
The database of population consists of birth records and police data focusing predominantly on birth, death, or a domicile of the inhabitants of Slovakia.
It seems that in real life it cannot, in its essence, react to often dynamic changes and incidences in life of a person.
Practice shows that the original purpose of the register of population does not allow for effective triggering of a mechanism of rapid warning aimed at protection of a person against disappearance.
Admittedly, the national integrated information and early warning system requires a huge number of personal data, a strict protection regime, as well as a strict maintenance regime.
In such a case, it would be useful for the Slovak people, but also for quality operation of police forces and intelligence services at their work in Slovakia and abroad.
Then, it would not be possible for human beings to disappear without a notice from the centre of the Slovak society.
In reality, it means that every citizen of the SR, eventually a foreign national situated on the territory of the SR would have an electronic file, which would include all data starting with birth (in case of foreign nationals their entry to the territory of the SR), visits of doctors, hospitals, kindergarten, school, employment and so on until their death.
Establishment of the institution for protection of children will fill an empty gap in Slovakia.
At the same time, this vulnerable group of non-adults has greater difficulties in claiming their rights than adults, and compared to them, they are at a disadvantage.
In the Slovak republic, it is inevitable to make protection and exercise of rights of our children more effective and to fulfil international obligations to which the Slovak republic has committed itself for the benefit of children.
Pursuant to the Convention on the Rights of a Child, Slovakia presents the UN Committee for the Rights of the Child with reports concerning measures adopted for exercise of rights stated in this Convention and on progress which has been made in exercising these rights.
The best solution seems to be an introduction of national "independent mechanism with a mandate to receive and investigate complaints made by children or on their behalf", that is "children's public defender of rights".
Simultaneously, to guarantee necessary human and financial resources for operation and activity of such a body.
• The Centre stresses inevitability of administering the tasks by the authorities for protection of rights in the best interest of a child with a due expertise and in an adequate period, since securing of relevant bodies on a due qualitative and quantitative level is responsibility of the state, alternatively the government and relevant departments.
• To improve cooperation and coordination among the subjects in question working with children, on a horizontal as well as a vertical level, and to systematically educate persons working with children and persons pertaining the rights of children.
• To interconnect the systems of central evidence of the inhabitants and municipal registry offices, health care and insurance companies, records of pupils and students, penal registers and so on.
At the same time, to raise rates in criminal code for battering a person entrusted into one's care and to ensure increased protection against battering of children.
• To explicitly introduce into a law and criminal code, in which cases a judge is only given a possibility, but when he/she is explicitly OBLIGED to order probation (in case of battering minor children, a person entrusted into one's care, close person and so on).
• To legalize only one central health insurance company, which would register all citizens and insurees in the SR.
• To design a methodological guideline for social guardianship, which will order an immediate action after child battering is reported.
• To legalize compulsory daily reporting of prisons to labour office (department of social guardianship) a record of people returning from prisons.
A worker of social guardianship should visit such families and investigate the situation at the given month.
• To interconnect systems of municipalities, schools and offices of labour with the police, health insurance companies and imprisonment institutions.
• To introduce an institute of children's public defender of rights, who would have an irreplaceable and specific status among state institutions of social help in Slovakia.
The children's public defender of rights would, besides other matters, deal with a scope of problems, which neither state, nor non-governmental institutions have directly managed and do not manage and he/she would provide clients with complex legal counselling free of charge, including provision of services of legal representation in specific cases, where children's rights are violated or misused.
Moreover, he/she would, in specific cases, immediately contact all competent authorities and institutions, in which scope of action is the subsequent solution of the given problem.
Justness of existence of such an institution is due to the abovementioned events, which happened in recent days, undeniable.
• To devise methodology of performing crisis intervention and other professional methods in crisis centres (also for sexually abused children).
• To improve professional level of workers participating in solving cases of abused and sexually abused children.
• To create and implement a complex system of professional help and control of children in foster homes care as prevention of violence and sexual abuse of children.
• To perform surveys concerning child abuse at least once a year.
• To implement for better informedness of the public (for cases of report of alleged violence) better advertising regarding this delicate topic in the media - press, radio, TV, so that it is clear to the public where is it supposed to turn to in an event of suspicion.
The development of global social relations in the field of human rights protection is constantly progressing.
Such persons are predominantly children.
The Slovak republic is also a member of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, an organisation the purpose of which is to introduce a forum designed for drawing various jurisdictions near taking into consideration supranational conflicts of these various jurisdictions.
One of the main areas of the Hague Conference on Private International Law is specially international protection of children.
The Slovak republic is a signatory of other international agreements adopted at the Council of Europe.
In the field of children's rights protection the European Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions Concerning Custody of Children and Restoration of Custody of Children published in the Collection of Laws under the No. 366/2001Coll. is predominantly relevant.
International protection of the rights of minor children is in the Slovak
184 The Convention on the Rights of the Child is published in the Collection of Laws under No. 104/1991 Coll. and has been effective for the Slovak republic since the year 1993
The CILPC administers its scope of action in the areas of claiming child maintenance and support allowance in accordance with the international conventions, it administers tasks of the central authority in the area of international abductions of children pursuant to the international conventions and legal acts of the European Union, it administers the task of the central authority in the area of inter-country adoptions pursuant to the international convention, as well as other tasks in the field of social and legal protection of children in relation to foreign countries according to the special guidelines, and it also provides free legal consultancy services in the area of family law with a foreign element, especially in the area of child maintenance and support allowance, the care for minor children and in the area of custody.
One of the crucial tasks of the CILPC is cooperation with state administration bodies and with partner authorities abroad.
Martinko had a genital infection.
The doctor alarmed the Social Service on the grounds of suspicion of battering with a sexual motive.
Paradoxically, their minor son had been treated with this health problem in another hospital, but since the treatment had not helped, the parents decided to change the doctor and the treatment.
Social workers were notified that it could have been a result of a "non-accidental injury", and so her sons were put into temporary care of an American pastor.
Thus began a long-term legal battle including many of court hearings, four different social workers, seven "expert" doctors and psychologists, 16 interpreters ^nddozensofjawyers^^^^^^
These allegations were not proved and their father was pleaded not guilty185.
However, British authorities did not return their children to them.
The Slovak institutions did not take any action in this case.
In July 2012, a representative of the Slovak Republic before the European Court of Justice in Strasbourg learned about the case; consequently on 3 August, 2012 she publicly expressed a serious concern over cases of adoptions of children removed from living biological parents without sound reasons happening on the basis of rulings of British courts and subject of which are also Slovak citizens.
She drew attention to the fact that the situation is also criticised by the British media, which in this respect draw attention to the system inadequacies.
John Hemming MP expressed his willingness to help Slovak citizens in an analogical situation with securing adequate legal representation in a proceeding before the English courts.
It was this MP, who notified the Slovak Republic of the opportunity to enter the proceeding as a third party.
He also confirmed that it is possible to request forgiveness for failing to file an appeal within the prescribed time period in the case of the Boór children.
Finally, this story has had a happy ending and the children have been placed into the mother's permanent care (source: noviny.sk, sme.sk).
Responsibility of competent authorities, institutions as well as involved inactive persons themselves

The Rights of the Child
their loving biological family back to the territory of Slovakia.
Specifically, it concerns the following responsible and competent authorities: the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family, and of course, the CILPC as an autonomous and independent institute.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, consulates of the SR abroad
Consular assistance abroad shall be provided to Slovak nationals in accordance with the Vienna Conventions on Consular Relations.
Pursuant to the present Convention, the Slovak consular officer may, beside other activities, contact relatives or acquaintances, who can send money to a citizen without financial means, recommend a local attorney, who will provide professional legal assistance in case of a contact of a citizen with the local police or court, recommend services of local doctors, interpreters, he/she safeguards the protection of rights and interests of the Slovak Republic and its nationals abroad, in cooperation with other ministries and other state authorities; he/she may advise on how to proceed in every case with knowledge of local circumstances.
The course of action of the officers of the Slovak Embassy in London in the case of Ivana Boórová started to be investigated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Miroslav Lajčák.
The cases triggered criticism of inactivity of the CILPC.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs argues that the Embassy cannot interfere in the proceedings in a British independent court.
It does everything that is in its capacity and what is allowed by the international conventions.
Centre for International Legal Protection of Children and Youth, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR
Responsibility for inactivity lies mainly in the hands of the CILPC, which is a partner organisation of the British authorities.
The CILPC is a state authority body with its scope of action in the territory of the Slovak republic.
It was established by the Ministry of Labour, Social Offices and Family of the SR as a directly managed budgetary organisation for safeguarding and providing legal protection for children and youth in relation to foreign countries effective since 1 February, 1993.
In the case of the CILPC, changes in personnel have already been made under a new director Andrea Cisárová.
The personnel of the CILCP, who had been in charge of the agenda relating to the children by August 2012, are no longer employees of the CILPC, by means of which responsibility for their inactivity has been drawn.
The Čonková Case
Following the outburst of the Boórová case, other families, whose children were taken away by the English authorities started to speak out via TV JOJ and other media (noviny.sk, sme. sk, pluska.sk, cas.sk) - among others also the Čonka family, who have left for England with a view of a better pay in order to improve the quality of life of their children, yet they have lost their children instead.
"The eldest son is eleven years old, the youngest girl a bit more than a month.
Five children from Slovakia stayed in Great Britain without their parents.
They were looking for a job.
After they have failed, they asked the social authorities for help.
The children were taken into temporary foster care.
190 Published on August 17, 2012, in Sme daily.
Annually, the National Fostering Agency gives away approximately EUR 165 million.
At present, the children, together with their parents, are already on the territory of Slovakia.
The Koštúrovci case
Slovakia has continued in saving children from the hands of the British Social Service.
Three children of Katarína Koštúrová, whose case received public attention again through the media (television JOJ), are also in a foster family.
The mother has lost her children due to alleged malnutrition.
The CILPC have requested their return home.
The Rebeka case
Not even four-month old Rebeka had spent five days in hospital due to the fact that she was crying when moving her hand.
It was found out that she had a broken collar-bone.
According to the family, it happened during vaccination, which they underwent the same day.
They were prohibited to leave the hospital and it continued in a court where a director of the Slovak CILPC Andrea Cisárová appeared.
Her request to enter the proceeding was registered, the judge explicitly said, that the parents could take Rebeka home.
The following morning, the family decided not to stay in Britain and go to Slovakia.
This decision was also supported by the lawyer who deals with this problem.

The Rights of the Child
The Kandráčovci case
In August, another case of child snatching happened - of 2 Roma girls Vaneska and Ninka, but under different circumstances.
After the parents of four children, the Kandráč family, ended up in prison, the grandmother left for England to take care of her grandchildren.
She took another granddaughter with her, who was in her custody in Slovakia.
One day, the British social authorities have taken her without any hesitation as well.
When they arrived to take the children away, they also took little Ninka, who did not belong to them.
She was entrusted into grandmother's custody.
Not even the paper stating that the conditions for upbringing the children in her house are absolutely all right helped her.
This case has been going on for two and a half years already.
The grandmother has not seen them for one year and eight months.
It is obvious that children do not belong into hands of criminals, but the fact that the grandmother has an interest to take care of the children should be taken into consideration by the British court, since in the first place, the child belongs to a circle of its biological family if it shows interest.
They did not manage to gain the right to their granddaughter on 17 March, 2013 in the Royal Court of Justice, which the director of the Slovak centre Andrea Cisárová attended.
A precedent in the case of Ivana Boórová should have been great hope for other Slovak families.
It seems that this statement is false.
(source: noviny.sk, TV JOJ).
Return of children "inappropriate" for adoption back to Slovaks by the British party
Slovakia has an experience with such cases in which the British allegedly choose only healthy children and they subsequently place them in foster families.
It cannot be claimed that all cases are unjustifiable.
Firstly, it is necessary to do everything in the best interest of the child and provided that there could be any danger in the form of battering or other form of ill-usage by parents, it is in the best interest of the child to get out of reach of such a parent as soon as possible.
Subsequently, however, the British court should duly gather evidence, so that it is really undeniable, without any doubts that the child cannot stay in care of parents any longer, as his/her health, nutrition and healthy development are threatened.
After the child is taken away, the court should contact the Slovak party to find out whether relatives of children in Slovakia are interested in them.
Following the statement of the Slovak Republic that a child does not have any relatives, or no relative is interested in taking care of a child personally, the British party should put a child to adoption.
"Sometimes it looks like in a shop.
Great Britain has returned two children back to Slovakia, who have been taken into forced adoption without prior asking.
The reason?
They have not been according to new parents' wishes.
A year ago, the British Social Services (SS) returned two siblings without our request.
They were ill and no one had shown any interest in ill children.
a matter of fact, no one has actively entered into the battle with Britain in this concrete case.
The CILPC does not have any evidence in relation to these children, it means that we did not have any information about the fact that such children should be adopted in Britain.
However, the British have decided this time that ill children are not "appropriate" for adoption in their country.
Practice in Anglo-Saxon law on the British Isles has pointed to a level of maturity of the Slovak legislature, a level of efficiency or inefficiency of practice under the Slovak legislature and the level of readiness or a lack of readiness of the Slovak bodies to protect the rights of children, including the best interest of children.
Legal relations with a foreign element show naked truth about the interstate system and its inadequacies in Slovakia.
A look at the isles over the Channel should be a look into a mirror, in which it is necessary to see a moral.
Otherwise, this dramatic experience was useless in spite of the most massive publicity of human rights in the year 2012.
Slovakia represents the environment, which needs to be improved.
Improved in favour of the best interest of children.
Improved in order to be a mature partner to the islanders in effective protection of children.
Different points of view
"While we are shouting at Britain, we should sweep our own doorstep first,"196 stated the Defender of Human Rights as other shocking cases and curious procedures of the Slovak authorities have emerged.
The results of her survey in the CILPC prove it as well.
195 Published on 11 October, 2012, source: noviny. sk, author: Dárius Haraksin.
196 Published on November 29, 2012, source: Sme. sk, author: Veronika Prušová.
Chapter 10.
"The outcomes of the analysis performed by means of investigation of the records concerning Great Britain unanimously prove inactivity, inefficiency, failure to take measures directed at repatriation of a child, alternatively an incorrect procedure of public administration bodies, as well as inadequate cooperation of the public administration bodies and central authorities under the Direction and in 58 per cent of the cases, the right of the child to such a procedure, which is in his/her best interest, has been violated.
Another inadequacy that was discovered was incorrect management of records, problems with managing translations and an inadequate method of communication among the central bodies (source: the Official Report of the PDR)" 198
The Centre addressed questions to the respective institutions asking whether and which of the measures have been taken and how.
The body of social and legal protection of children and social guardianship administers regulations necessary for protection of the child without delay, and it pays special attention to cases with an international element.
The General Director of the Central Office considers the Report biased, since according to his opinion, the Office of the PDR based their findings on the documentation managed by the CILPC and it was not possible to assess objectively the professional level of administered measures of social and legal protection of children and social custody.
According to his statements, the state authorities of the Slovak Republic have, in the given cases, not made any mistakes, as claimed by the Public Defender of Rights in the Report, and their procedure was in line with valid legal regulations, which are binding for them.
199 Statement of the General Director of the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the SR referring the questions of the Centre from 25 March, 2013.
Due to the ever-growing number of cases belonging to the scope of the agenda, the CILPC plans to increase the number of lawyers.
At present, none of the lawyers responsible for the agenda concerning minor children and their return to Slovakia by August 2012, is an employee of the CILPC any longer.
Resolute personnel changes concerning the people managing the respective files have been made.
The CILPC has also introduced deadlines for dealing with the files, eventually with supplementary information request; in very urgent supplementary information requests by return not later than within a time period of 3 working days and with other supplementary information requests the time period for dealing with the supplementary information request is specified in the period of 7 working days.
In spite of this, the CILPC gives priority to requests and supplementary information requests, and it tries to deal with them by return or in the shortest time possible.
Another significant step made by the CILPC under the leadership of the new director is preparation of a Memorandum.
Representative of the Slovak republic before the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg and resolutions adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe
In the year 2012, the function of the representative of the SR before the European Court for Human Rights (hereinafter referred to as "ECHR") in Strasbourg was performed by JUDr.
Marica Pirošíková, who on 3 August, 2012 publicly expressed her concern over the cases of adoptions of children with living biological parents without sound reasons occurring on the basis of decisions of the British courts.
As stated in the report, children should be separated from their biological parents only in extreme cases since the family environment creates the best conditions for life.
The report on human rights and family courts invites the meber states to sign it, alternatively to ratify all the relevant conventions of the CoE on the rights of children and implementation of guidelines VM CoE from the year 2010 on judiciary oriented on children (child-friendly justice).
The Assembly focused attention to the principal legal guidelines in this field and repeated its request addressed to the member states of the CoE to reinforce their respective policy in such a way as to sign and ratify the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption and the European Convention on the Adoption of Children with a view of effective protection of children in inter-country adoption, as well as the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (CETS 201).
At the same time, the Assembly requested the member states to develop the national policy focusing on establishing fully controlled procedures of inter-country adoption, in which central bodies ensuring control over standards and practices of adoption would be included, and to develop rules and standards for preparation, operation and control by professionals over adoption agencies as well as to secure complete documentation of origin and personal identity of a child in the process of adoption and afterwards.
On 11 December, 2012 the representative was sent a report on removal of children from biological families in Sweden and other Nordic states which was addressed to the Secretary General of the CoE.
The professionals, who designed the report, request the Council of Europe, the Minister Committee and the Parliamentary Assembly for a thorough investigation of the very prevalent and destructive child removal cases that are being practised in the Nordic countries on a daily basis.
Since the beginning of the 80s, a great number of families fled Sweden in order to protect children against their removal and placing into foster care.
According to the report, from 1920 to the present date, 300,000 children have been removed in Sweden in this way.
A great deal of cases of taking children from their parents without sound reasons appearing in various countries points, according to the representative, to the need to establish an international forum, which would consider solutions to this, it seems, widespread international problem.
Conclusion
It has become a signatory of important international agreements designed in interest of protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The Slovak Republic by its entrance into the international system of protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms has also accepted a positive obligation not only in a passive position to perform its obligations from international agreements in the area of human rights and fundamental freedoms, but also in an active perception of adoption of measures on a national level, which deepen the protection of the rights guaranteed by the international agreements even further.
Practice in Anglo-Saxon law on the British Isles has pointed to a level of maturity of the Slovak legislature, a level of efficiency or inefficiency of practice under the Slovak legislature and the level of readiness or unpreparedness of the Slovak bodies to protect the rights of children, including the best interest of children.
Slovakia represents the environment which needs to be improved.
Improved in order to be a mature partner to the islanders in the effective protection of children.
In practical implementation of provisions and legal norms in the Slovak Republic it is possible to identify inadequacies also in the active application of supranational norms.
The question of financing the social and family policy of the state in relation (not only) to minor children is the question, which will probably not be adequately solved in a short time.
Nevertheless, an economic weakness does not rid the state of the obligation to observe its human and legal obligations.
In the respective area the Centre:
• Emphasizes inevitability of securing real implementation and exercise of international obligations in the best interest of the child, including safeguarding permanent monitoring and assessment of their exercise as well as their real enforcement and sanctioning by competent authorities.
• Emphasizes an inevitability of fulfilling tasks by the authorities for protection of the rights in the best interest of the child with due expertise and in an adequate time period, since providing for the relevant authorities on respective qualitative and quantitative level represents responsibility of the state, or the government and the respective departments.
• Recommends to develop and file a proposal for issuing a generally binding directive, or other legal enactment, stipulating maximum time periods for public administration bodies, during which individual actions in safeguarding rights of the child shall be performed.
• Recommends the Minister of
Labour, Social Affairs and Family to introduce control mechanism for investigating the status and correctness of dealing with the files concerning minor children, either on the territory of the Slovak Republic or of a foreign state.
• Recommends the Centre of
• Recommends the Central Office to design an internal norm for improving presented reports from investigations of circumstances, in which the child finds itself for purposes of decisions for our and foreign courts in such a way, that this norm governs minutely how, in what way, to what extent and what details, and which specific matters need to be investigated, examined, and at the same time it precisely specifies how should the report look like and what it needs to satisfy and what should it contain.

Human rights are an inherent part of life of every person, including children, the elderly, foreigners, people in need, persons with disabilities or other groups of the population.
Observance of human rights supports diversity in society but also creates opportunities for selfrealisation and self-determination of persons belonging to vulnerable groups as well as brings about numerous benefits for the majority.
Human rights are closely linked to tolerance and nondiscrimination.
Based on the Antidiscrimination Act, the Centre acts as the only Slovak equal treatment authority (i.e. equality body).
The Centre has a specific status among human rights structures in Slovakia.
It is a national human rights institution accredited within the UN system.
In terms of EU legal order, the Centre represents a specialised national equality body in Slovakia and is a member of EQUINET- the European Network of Equality Bodies.
Based on its mandate, the Centre monitors and evaluates the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the principle of equal treatment, in the Slovak Republic.
The HR Report for 2016 elaborates on selected issues of human rights and freedoms, extremism, principle of equal treatment and discrimination.
It focuses on those human rights and freedoms, which were subject to public debate or showed gaps in enjoyment or challenges in protection in the previous year.
The aim of the HR Report is to provide an objective, true and current picture of the human rights situation in the Slovak Republic in the previous year with regards to the monitored areas and provide recommendations to support more effective protection and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.
The Centre addressed a wide range of relevant stakeholders, including public bodies, public institutions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) active in the area of human rights with request for information required to evaluate accurately the human rights situation in Slovakia.

IMPACTS OF CHICANE

1.1 Extremism and legal limits of the freedom of expression
Pursuant to Article 1 para. Two subparas.
a) and b) of the Act on Establishment of the Centre, the Centre monitors and evaluates human rights and for this purposes gathers and upon request provides information on racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism in Slovakia.
The Centre, thus, brings analysis of current situation concerning enjoyment of the freedom of expression and its legal limits in terms of extremist or radical expressions.
In general, freedom of expression has certain limits and should not be interpreted absolutely.
1.1.1 Limits of the freedom of expression under the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights
The Centre carefully analyses relevant jurisprudence and applies it to the current situation regarding the enjoyment of the freedom of expression.
It underlines the established gaps and recommends clearer definition of limits of the freedom of expression.
Enjoyment of the freedom of expression is a subjective right of every individual.
This right is tied to an obligation of everybody, including the state, not to preclude anybody from freely expressing his or her opinions.
ECtHR has stated: “Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society, which is one of the basic condition of its progress and development of every man."
The Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic (the Constitutional Court) has found that “by the freedom of expression a person is guaranteed to express his or her feelings, thoughts and opinions or to remain silent.
The freedom of expression is a basic political right.
Limitations of this freedom are admissible and anticipated by the ECHR itself.
5 Finding of the Constitutional Court SR, II ÚS 28/96, of 12.5.1997.
Article 10 para. 2 ECHR explicitly highlights that the freedom of expression brings about the obligation and responsibility of those exercising it.
He continued using this rhetoric also during national court proceedings.
6 ECtHR Judgement in case Surek v. Turkey, application number 26682/95.
8 ECtHR Judgement in case Witzsch v. Germany, application number 1485/03.
social peace and prohibition of discrimination.
Hence, ECtHR rejected the application.
Apart from anti-Semitic expression, ECtHR has also been handling freedom of expression cases concerning anti-immigration and anti-muslimism rhetoric.
In case Norwood v. United Kingdom, ECtHR applied Article 17 ECHR.
10 ECtHR Judgement in case Garaudy v. France, application number 65831/01.
Hate speech occurs more frequently in the virtual sphere and it represents a common form of defamation of various groups of population or incitement to hatred and violence against certain groups.
It often includes incitement or justifying hatred for various reasons that copy the protected grounds of discrimination listed in the Antidiscrimination Act11.
In 2016, within its monitoring activities, the Centre recorded several hate speech incidents.
The reason behind increasing radicalisation and hate speech is often a support of the so-called inclining majority that itself does not create expressions of hatred but sympathises with their content.
The Centre monitors increased hate speech also in relation to the migrant crisis, which is frequently misinterpreted and linked solely to Muslim culture and terrorist attacks in Europe.
This made the topic a subject to hatred and mis-information of the society, unfortunately also by media.
Authors of hate speech in the virtual world often refer to the freedom of speech.
They see themselves as victims of persecution for expressing their opinion.
The freedom of expression protects constructive and substantiated criticism of political situation.
Thus, those expressions that intend to bring founded criticism of the EU migration policies cannot be seen as unprotected by the freedom of expression.
Authors of hate speech overload the Internet with opinions covered by migrant crisis issues, although their primary aim is often to spread hatred towards certain groups, such as national minorities, sexual minorities and Muslims.
Many news are unfounded on evidence or based on unverified sources causing a high level of disinformation of people.
11 See Article 2 para. 1 of the Antidiscrimination Act.
In a democratic society, media are de facto not limited in spreading information.
They themselves decide, which information to publish and in what context.
In many cases, the media news create space for increased hate speech of their followers.
The freedom of the press should primarily reflect public interest in receive information and not call for sensations.
In terms of hate speech, it is crucial to distinguish its author and those spreading it.
Dangerous spreading of hate speech by radical individuals on the Internet enhance artificial creation of incidents causing public defamation and incitement to hatred toward a certain group of people.
In the Slovak virtual space, this would affect mainly Muslims and Roma.
Publishing personal opinions on the Internet represent a public self-realisation of an individual.
Public expression of thoughts, opinions or feelings is, however, limited by human rights and freedoms of others.
This applies also in the so-called virtual space.
The Centre particularly welcomes the efforts of the so-called repressive bodies of the state to eliminate hate speech from public life and their efforts to achieve the most effective implementation of legal mechanisms in practice.
One of the main functions of fine imposition for extremist crimes is their repressive impact to deter other potential perpetrators of these crimes.
Statistical data show a minor decrease in criminally prosecuted persons compared to the previous years.
This can consequently affect human rights and freedoms of other persons.
The increased rate of radical and extremist expressions on the Internet is alarming.
The presence of extremist and radical attitudes against certain groups of the population is visible in the virtual space.
Debating individuals, often under false identities, present opinions that are likely to incite hatred towards races, nations, nationalities, ethnicities or other groups of population.
Publicly presented expressions with such content do not benefit from legal protection of the freedom of expression.
Young people often lack natural barriers against extremist expressions and do not realise possible impacts of their conduct.
In terms of prevention, education process should be supplemented by a subject aimed at sensitising legal awareness among young people.
The Centre welcomes the efforts of the state to fight extremisms in Slovakia.
However, it calls for much higher prevention activities.
13 Statement of the General Prosecutors to the request of the Centre of 21.2.2017 - National Unit to Fight Terrorism and Extremism is a unit of the National Criminal Agency of the Police Force.
These trainings cover mainly the limits of the freedom of expression in terms of radical or extremist expressions.
The Centre recommends that:
Pursuant to Article 7 para. 5 of the Constitution, CRPD is an international treaty that has precedence over national laws.
It is crucial that the society pays closer attention to the rights of PwD, which cannot remain at a theoretical level but should fully be implemented in practice.
The requirement of accessibility stems from Article 9 CRPD.
The Centre is concerned by the persistent challenges and levels of the accessibility of the physical environment.
Dolný Kubín (DD PF DK) and a building of the Slovak Post (SP) in Košice.
In 2016, the Control and Inspection Section at the Ministry of Interior requested the Centre to issue a written statement concerning the violation of rights of PwD in relation to the lack of accessible entrance to the building of DD PF DK and the lack of technical equipment allowing PwD (with limited mobility) to move within its premises.
The Control and Inspection Section at the Ministry of Interior based its request on a complaint by a PwD in a wheelchair.
In cooperation with the director of DD PF DK, the Centre's representative inspected the premises of DD PF DK building.
According to DD PF DK, the offices mostly visited by people are located on the first floor.
There is also the department of (identification) documents.
PwD can reach the first floor with the help of other person or employees of DD PF DK.
Employees of the Ministry of Interior mainly use other two floors.
In case PwD need to contact employees located on the second or
third floor, they can do so on the first floor of the building.
Within the process of elimination of barriers in the building of DD PF DK, the Support Centre Žilina informed that the Ministry of Interior contracted in 2014 an elaboration of energetic audit within a project financed from the structural funds to optimise measures in the area of energetic effectivity of public buildings.
This project also includes also the DD PF DK building.
The Ministry of Interior informed that the public tender for construction works
14 Statement of DD PF DK of 18.2.2016.
17 Statement of the Support Centre Žilina of 19.2.2016.
Deadline for reconstruction and modernisation of the building is 6 months since the construction side is made availabile to the provider.
In its expert opinion, the Centre concluded that the current situation establishes violation of Article 9 CRPD.
Despite this, the Centre welcomes efforts of DD PF DK to address the needs of PwD by implementing alternative measures.
The Centre, however, remains concerned that certain processes could interfere into the personal dignity of PwD.
Respect for inherent dignity, personal independence, freedom of choice and independence, non-discrimination
The process of elimination of barriers can sometimes be challenged also by the fact that some buildings are considered national cultural heritage.
Such issue has arisen in relation to a building, which is a seat of the SP at Poštová Street in Košice (SP Košice 1).
As an alternative solution to mitigate the negative situation, SP has introduced the socalled special regime of service available publicly to costumers of SP Košice 1 during office hours.
Upon contact, this employee comes outside to serve the costumer.
ST, unfortunately, rejected the proposal concerning the backyard due to security risks, which must be taken into account by the owner of the building.
It should be available for persons in wheelchairs with limited mobility, parents with pushchairs as well as for seniors.
It also stated that it is in the interest of the monument protection of the building that the building serves its original purposes with the aim of preserving its monumental value.
According to SP, the city proposes a sloping hydraulic platform, which it believes would not assist all individuals who may face challenges to enter the building.
The pertaining negative situation caused by the lack of accessibility causes unacceptable barrier for persons dependent on accessibility, despite there would be

The Centre requests the competent stakeholders to pay due attention to those persons who would be forced to keep handling their personal issues outside in the street due to obstacles caused by 14 stairs precluding their access to the premises of SP Košice 1.
2.2 Amendment of the Act on Financial Contributions to Compensate Severe Disability
The Centre requested further information from the Ministry of Labour, the National Council of Citizens with Disabilities of the Slovak Republic (NCCwD SR) and the Office of the Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities.
24 Statement of the Ministry of Labour regarding the Centre's request of 3.3.2017.
26 Act No. 601/2003 Coll. on Subsistence Minimum and amending and supplementing certain acts.
We believe that it is not in compliance with good manners to lower contributions for a person with severe disability due to accepting a gift from other sources than a state budget.
”29 According to the Office of the Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, “the Commissioner proposed within the comment procedure to exclude all gifts received by persons with severe disabilities, irrespective of their amount and provider, from property assessment of a person with disability for the purposes of compensation of severe disabilities.
Based on this, the Ministry of Labour does not consider this regulation discriminatory.
The Centre contested the proposal and required that this differentiation be cancelled.
The Centre requested that equal amount of the financial contribution for nursing both for nursing persons in the productive age and those receiving some pension is introduced.
It further proposed that the provision applies to nursing persons receiving some pension under the law.
NCCwD SR also addressed the issue: “We consider provision of different rate of financial contribution for nursing, based on whether a nursing person receives a pension
It finds the contribution discriminatory against persons receiving some pension under the law.
The Office of the Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities further informed that the Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities proposed equal rate of the contribution for both groups.
In case the legislator did not accept the proposal, the Commissioner proposed an alternative to increase rate of the contribution for nursing persons receiving some pension by an equal coefficient as applies for persons in the productive age.
The regulation contested by various subjects was not modified.
Moreover, the amount of the contribution was only increased with regard to a selected group of nursing persons.
According to the Ministry of Labour: “The Ministry of Labour plans to continue to increase effectivity of integration measures for persons with severe disabilities in the upcoming future in order to achieve optimisation and directness offinancial contributions to compensate social impacts of severe disabilities.
Changes should concern also conditions of provision of the contribution for nursing.
To conclude, the Centre underlines the fact that several stakeholders contested the discriminatory nature of the proposed regulation within the comment procedure.
Despite this, their requests were not addressed in the final version of the amendment.
35 Statement of the Ministry of Labour regarding the Centre's request of 3.3.2017.
In terms of conduct or omissions of public bodies, the law providing protection of individual rights of persons and legal entities is the Act on Complaints.
The proposal raised a criticism among commenting stakeholders, media and concerned public.
It should also reflect legislative developments, which could affect the procedure or ways of investigating and handling complaints.
Within the inter-resort comment procedure, the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) expressed concerns over this regulation.
Similarly, the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic (the Ministry of Justice)

In case the health condition of the complainant prohibits him or her to prepare a written complain, an employee of the public body does so on his or her behalf.
The obligation of the complainant to provide all the required information is not affected.
The Explanatory Memorandum was respectively consolidated.
Oral complaints have a relatively long tradition in Slovakia and have been beneficial

It was never investigated why the complainant had opted for an oral complaint.
The draft amendment makes oral complaints inadmissible.
Complainant is thus facing certain minimum requirements - i.
The Centre finds it inacceptable that a complainant whose health condition precludes him or her to prepare a written complaint alone would anyhow have to identify himself or herself to an employee of any public body with a PWD card, medical confirmation or detail information of his or her health condition.
Such situation could be a base for further discrimination.
Besides that, the Centre believes that the draft amendment of the Act on Complaints failed to take into account persons unable to file or prepare a written complaint e.
g. due to social disadvantages (poverty or culture), illiteracy, lack of administrative skills, low knowledge of language or grammar, lack of education or insufficient material resources.
complaints to public bodies.
The draft amendment does not recognise such option.
Another option would be to empower his or her legal representative.
š
Any complaint submitted this way will have to be confirmed and duly signed within five working days upon submission, otherwise it would be closed.
It is expected that this would support wider implementation in practice of electronic communication secured by qualified electronic signature or qualified electronic seal, which is so far used in practice very limitedly.

5. Legal aid providers either financed by the state - the Legal Aid Centre and the Centre - as well as non-governmental organisations and social work service providers introduce among their services also legal aid, assistance and instruction to prepare and file written complaints with an aim to prevent and eliminate disadvantages on any ground to seek rights in this form.
Already in its 2013 HR Report, the Centre warned against the increasing tendency of their construction.
Based on their statements, it can be concluded that the segregation of Roma population from the majority by walls or fences persists in 8 cities or municipalities.
The city of Prešov was the only one to remove the wall.
The city of Košice did not answer the request of the Centre.
It provides protection and prevention but it is also used for games and sport activities as well as artistic activities for children in forms of graffiti.
The city of Zlaté Moravce stated that it aimed to support the Roma population in
various areas and the results are visible.
Hence, the city does not consider its elimination.
Two 2-meter tall fences were constructed in Plavecký Štvrtok to protect private property.
The number of complaints and conflicts among the population decreased as well as the level of damage on surrounded houses.
The city finds the wall meaningful and fulfilling its purpose.
Thus, its removal is not being considered.
Decisions of cities and municipalities to construct walls, fences or other barriers do not solve the issues and do not give raise to integration of Roma into the majority society.
The Centre criticises the selfgovernments for creating barriers instead of using all lawful measures available.
Construction of walls and fences is closely related to the issue of housing.
Discrimination of Roma appears in various areas but it is mostly obvious in the area of housing.
Roma housing is a persisting problem in Slovakia.
Roma often live in settlements, which in large parts do not fulfil technical, and hygienic standards.
Territorial segregation has impacts on social, economic and living conditions of the community.
The Centre contests the fact that despite this commitment the Slovak practice still reveals territorial residential segregation of Roma.

The Centre (repeatedly) recommends that:
The Ministry of Labour improve housing conditions of Roma through social work.
The Ministry of Labour decrease special residential segregation of Roma.
The Ministry of Labour in cooperation with territorial self-governments increase the percentage of Roma houses with access to basic infrastructure.
The Ministry of Labour in cooperation with territorial self-governments increase the percentage of Roma citizen living in lawful settlements and on lands with legally settled ownership.
The Ministry of Interior seek financial means for Roma civic guards under financial dotation, grants etc.
Cities and municipalities, upon availability, use the so-called Roma civic guards.
4.2 Independent investigation in the crisis accommodation facility Kotva
The petition was initiated upon a suicide of a former client of Kotva, which caused tension among the clients of Kotva.
The Centre conducted an independent investigation on 13.7.2016 in the presence of the city's representatives.
On 9.8.2016, the regional representative met again with the clients of Kotva to discuss current issues in the facility.
The clients of Kotva contested in the petition that they could not do their laundry after 5 p.m. The provider informed the Centre that in later hours, there is an issue with non-removal of the laundry from the machines.
The most critical part of the petition was the prohibition of visits.
currently standard and the city finds it adequate with regards to the composition of clients.
A dormitory in Bratislava refused to prolong accommodation of two Roma due to their ethnicity.
The owner of the facility claimed that one of the floors, which was intended for Roma people, was fully booked.
Despite availability of rooms on other floors, the dormitory refused to prolong accommodation of these persons.
The co-owner stated that they separated Roma from other clients due to the fear of losing non-Roma clients.
Non-Roma clients were refusing to share rooms or even the same floor with Roma.
The co-owners of the facility engaged in direct discrimination based on ethnicity, in particular against two Roma persons.
Their established practice concerning provision of accommodation services is segregation and causes indirect discrimination of Roma.
50 Statement of the city of Banská Bystrica regarding the Centre's request of 3.2.2017.
Hence, the conduct of the co-owners was unacceptable and unlawful in terms of the antidiscrimination legislation.
The Centre was interested to provide its legal aid to the discriminated Roma.
It contacted a responsible person of a company that employed the Roma in construction works and through this person the Centre sought to obtain a written power of attorney to represent them.
Since the Centre did not succeed, it was not entitled to represent the victims of discrimination.
The Centre also requested cooperation from the Slovak Trade Inspection (STI) and asked to be informed in case of a subsequent inspection in the dormitory.
2. The owners of the accommodation facility refrain from segregation caused by division of floors in the accommodation facility.
Low or inferior education hinders the chances of young people to find employment and succeed in the labour market.
It is a Slovak reality that students from socially excluded communities do not have comparable opportunities when entering into educational process, often due to family conditions and poverty.
Within this cooperation, SSI informed the Centre about relevant results of state school inspections.
Found cases of segregation in education were based on real or symbolic separation of particular groups of students from the majority.
In the academic year 2015/2016, SSI found segregation practices in two inspected schools regarding education of Roma students and in two schools in terms of enrolment of students from MRC into special classes without prior diagnostics.
Elementary School with Kindergarten, Hlavná 267, Kuzmice
Documentation of elementary school students with special upbringing and educational needs was incomplete.
Certain files missed reports from special pedagogical examination and a re-diagnostics recommended by counselling facilities was not realised.
Based on written requests of legal representatives, conclusions of psychological examination and without special pedagogical examination, the students concerned were unlawfully enrolled in special classes by decision of a headmaster upon debate in the pedagogical council.
Within inspection of documentation of 1st grade students enrolled in a special class for pupils with low level of mental disability, SSI found that 4 pupils from MRC were enrolled in such class upon special pedagogical examination in the Centre of special pedagogical counselling (CSPC), which diagnosed them with psychosocial deprivation as well as emotional and social immaturity, but not with retardation.
These examinations were not preceded by any examinations in the Centre of pedagogical and psychological counselling and prevention (CPPCaP).
The situation was redressed by examination of these students in CPPCaP Prešov.
4 classrooms were located in the distant building and were attended solely by pupils from MRC.
The school's headmaster informed the Centre that he has decided to relocate pupils or enrol new children in classes in such a way to decrease a percentage of pupils from MRC.
He also stated that the school reassessed enrolment of pupils from MRC based on dialogues with their legal representatives and a questionnaire.
The measure was implemented by 2.9.2016.
SSI conducted a subsequent inspection in the school on 13.9.2016 in order to monitor elimination of the established deficiencies and found out that the recommendation to eliminate segregation has been fulfilled.
Elementary School, Komenského 135/6, Medzilaborce
In this school, a class (5.
B) was established purely for pupils from MRC despite the fact that the school could enrol them in a parallel 5th grade class.
At the time of the inspection, Roma students from the upper grade classes were eating in separated classrooms.
The elementary school submitted the Centre a report on implementation of imposed measures.
Since 5.9.2016, all students have been eating together in the canteen.
Four special classes (2.
B) were attended solely by Roma students.
These students, upon approval of their legal representatives, were diagnosed in CPPCaP and CSPC.
Based on the diagnostics, the school opened a special class for these students in the academic year 2016/2017.
Thus, a special class was established upon recommendation of consultancy facilities.
Nine students remained in a special class and others were integrated into a parallel class.
The elementary school stated that under the previous management certain Roma children ate meals separately.
The underlying reason was an aim to partially compensate deficits in insufficient hygiene and lack of eating habits.
Neither Roma nor non-Roma community found it to cause segregation.
No other activities were realised separately for Roma and non-Roma children, including the education.
In a letter addressed to the Centre, the headmaster stated: “Since 2013, the new management has been seeking to introduce certain organisation changes to promote inclusion of students from marginalised Roma communities.
We respect diversity of opinions in the school and aim to comprehensively address all factors that contribute to eliminate segregation.
We seek to implement de-segregation strategies and become a pro-inclusion school.
We pay due attention to equal opportunities to access good quality education.
We use various integration tools (teacher assistants, all day upbringing system, students' parliament, participation in projects and training programmes for teachers, interest facilities for students from socially disadvantaged environment, school trips, monthly events and quizzes upon auspices of a special pedagogue).
We accent multicultural elements in education processes.
The Centre believes that discrimination and segregation in education fundamentally determines social, economic, moral and legal success of Slovakia and its population in future decades.
It is part of a wider issue resulting from the constantly postponed reorganisation and reform of education system in Slovakia, particularly elementary school education.
This is currently not a reality in relation to groups and generations of students of certain social status, ethnicity or based on locality where they live.
The Centre recommends that:
1. The Slovak Republic, through training and methodological institutions, increase level and professional abilities of pedagogues and train them to support personal growth and tolerance among all students.
4. The Ministry of Education specify de-segregation and inclusion, prepare relevant methodologies and explain them to schools as well as support schools in implementing related educational and pedagogical processes.
6. Schools and school facilities integrate Roma children within the majority when possible, since mixed classes benefit social education of all children and can support better acceptance of diversities in adulthood.
9. Schools and school facilities, municipalities and cities create, maintain and actively offer extra-curricular and interest activities accessible for all children.
5.2 Diagnostics within enrolment into primary schools
The number of students and children with Slovak nationality is 769 198.
In these terms, it is particularly important to research relatively high percentual proportion in elementary schools and special elementary schools including special classes in elementary schools (graph no. 3).

PERCENTAGE OF ROMA CHILDREN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND SPECIAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS (INCLUDING SPECIAL CLASSES)
Source: CVTI SR
The Centre is concerned by the fact that (as stated by the Research Institute for Child Psychology and Pathopsychology) testing measures in Roma language are not used in diagnostics practice and no psychological diagnostic measures in Roma language are being prepared either.
In Slovakia, psychological tests are not available in a language of any other national minority.
When testing a child from Roma community who does not sufficiently understand the Slovak language, CPPCaP address this barrier with several approaches (exclusion of verbal parts of tests, using Roma language, presence of a third person who knows Roma language during less complex verbal tasks).
Based on lower level of knowledge of the Slovak language, a certain group of children is disadvantaged within testing.
It is

Upon completion of a special elementary school for students with intellectual disabilities, the achieved level of education does not entail to lower secondary education, i.e. full termination of an elementary school, as compared to standard elementary schools.
School curricula absent certain subjects or the difficulty and content of the subject matter is lower, which is natural and objectively justified with regards to specificities of the target group.
other criteria required by the school).
Supplementary lower secondary education for graduates of special elementary schools for students with intellectual disabilities can be gained through “courses” organised in standard elementary schools or secondary vocational schools that are completed by a panel examination from all subjects.
56 Despite this option, which graduates may not be aware of, its real application is linked to certain practical problems, both objective and subjective.
Organisation of such qualification courses is voluntary and, for various reasons (e.g. personal resources), not every school offers it.
1. The Ministry of Education map and propose optimisation of available support forms for graduates of special elementary schools who show interest to gain lower secondary education (secondary education).
5. The Ministry of Education assess options to create special classes at secondary vocational schools for selected professional education, in relation to which lower intellectual disabilities do not preclude further education.
Violence against women is a pertaining problem in our society.
In general, violence can be defined as any form of harming, threatening, showing dominance, physical, sexual or psychological pressure or abuse of power.
Violence is usually identified with physical violence, however, it has many different forms.
There are also more concrete definitions of domestic violence.
A vast proportion of domestic violence is committed against females.
This is caused by the fact that women are usually physically weaker than men.
Legislation often uses only gender-neutral formulations.
International conventions and documents tend to use a more narrow term - violence against women.
58 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women defines violence against women as “any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life “.
These include recommendations to increase the number of shelters for abused women, to secure sustainable operation of the free nonstop national helpline for women experiencing violence against women (national helpline) and of the Coordinating Methodical Centre for Gender-Based and Domestic Violence (Coordinating Methodical Centre).
This can be caused by an increased trust in authorities as well as by a higher determination of women to resolve this problem.
The Centre keeps underlying the need to increase trust of abused women towards authorities to raise the number of reported and investigated cases.
This can be achieved through trainings for Police Force members and persons who offer first contact to the victims of violence when reporting crimes.
The knowledge of Police Force members on the issues of violence against women and proper communication with victims can positively influence resolution of the problem.
In 2016, 136 women contacted the support centrum Civil Association Family Help (Občianske združenie Pomoc rodine), while 49 of them did so for the first time.
The most common violator was the current or former partner.
physical followed by economical violence, isolation and stalking.
The least common form was sexual violence.
The civil association Woman in Distress (OZ Žena v tiesni) recorded in 2016 an increase of cases by 100, while it continued providing specialised consultancy to women from previous years (97 in total).
The most common violator reported by the victims was their partner or husband.
The most common form was psychological violence, which was reported in 90 % of cases.
Physical violence was reported in 60 % of claims, while economical violence in 30 %.
Sexual violence was alleged in 10 % of cases.
6.1 Perception of gender-based violence in the Slovak Republic
Results of 2016 Eurobarometer show how the Slovak population perceives genderbased violence.
Approximately 27 % of Slovaks believe that violence against women is not common in Slovakia, 3% of them even believe that it is not widespread in Slovakia at all.
5 % of Slovaks find violence against women acceptable in certain situations.
63 Special Eurobarometer: Report: Gender- based violence, 2016. [quoted on 2017-03-02].
10 % of Slovak respondents have noticed violence against acquaintances, friends or family (with regards females).
In relation to neighbourhood and surrounding, i.e. not close acquaintances, this number increased to 19 %.
If a person is aware of committed violence, he or she can report it.
65 Otherwise he or she can face sanction of imprisonment for three years.
The research results show that the Slovak population does not perceive violence against women intensively enough.
It is thus crucial to constantly inform people in Slovakia about available means of helping victims of domestic violence and the graveness of the issue as well as the need of its solution.
6.1.1 Coordinating Methodical Centre for Gender-Based and Domestic Violence and National helpline for women experiencing violence
Establishment of the coordinating and methodical centre results also from recommendations of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.
The Coordinating Methodical Centre together with the national helpline fulfil one of the requirements under the Istanbul Convention.
The Ministry of Labour stated that from the total number of phone calls it was not

Pursuant to the database of clients of the national helpline, the most common perpetrator is a current or former partner or husband (in more than 90 % of cases).

There is still not a sufficient number of support facilities for abused women.
According to the minimum standards of the Council of Europe, Slovakia should have approximately 240 of such facilities.
The head of Department of Gender Equality and Equal
[quoted on 2017-03-08].
The efforts to increase the number of such facilities, particularly in areas with higher numbers of cases, are very welcome.
An amendment of the Act No. 372/1990 Coll. on Offences as amended (the Act on Offences) also entered into force on 1.1.2016.
The amendment changed a group of offences against civic cohabitation covering psychological, physical violence or threats of such conduct against a close person.

Slovakia has yet to adopt special legislation on domestic violence and maintains only the criminal law regulation.
If domestic violence reaches the intensity of crime, it qualifies as one of the crimes against family and youth, against life and health, against freedom and human dignity or other as relevant.
The need to adopt legislation on protection of victims of crimes is also debated in the society.
The regulation replaced the term interim measure.
The Court is entitled to order urgent measures whenever before, during or after the procedure.
In terms of violence against women, it is also important to mention regulation of Article 325 para. 2 subparas.

The Centre requested relevant information from the Ministry of Justice.
According the Ministry of Justice, the deadline for this task was postponed until 30.6.2017 upon request.
It further stated that submission of the proposal for ratification of the Istanbul Convention into the inter-resort comment procedure could be expected in the coming weeks.
TV JOJ, Noviny at 16:00.
be submitted without undue delay.
6.3.1 Attitudes of Slovak citizens regarding the Istanbul Convention
With regards to re-opening of the ratification of the Istanbul Convention there has been various opinions in the society.
The Centre informed about the petition in its 2015 HR Report, which referred that the petition had more than 5 000 signatures.
The Centre recommended the Slovak citizens to study related issues before signing such documents and petitions.
In 2016, the number of signatures more than doubled (the petition gained support of approximately 13 600 persons).
With regards to misleading and incorrect interpretations provided by various (mainly Cristian) organisations it is crucial to intensively spread correct information.
The Centre keeps appealing to people in Slovakia to double-check information before joining similar activities.
5. Self-governing regions, cities, municipalities and non-governmental sector increase number of shelter homes for abused women.
One of the underlying reasons is that the world population is ageing.
Population ageing is a pertaining problem.
In developed countries, the population over 60 will double in the upcoming decades.
It is assumed, that in developing countries the population over 60 will triple by 2050.
These changes will bring new challenges in redistribution of resources, participation in political and social life, social care and health care.
In this new demographical environment, states will face human rights challenges.
[quoted on 2017-01-25].
Hence, the efforts to tackle stereotypes and create better conditions for employment, education or participation in events should be a challenge for the whole society.
Older persons often face the so-called ageism, which can be defined as a form of discrimination and prejudice against the elderly.
Persons of higher age constantly experience rejection in various areas of life.
Rejection of older persons is very visible in employment since employers prefer to hire younger persons.
Hence, the only income of older persons is their pension, which is often not enough to cover their basic needs.
The elderly often reach the edge of poverty, which in connection with ageism, places them at the edge of society.
Absence of specific measures on the rights of the elderly causes older persons to live in poverty, with untreated diseases, as homeless or in inadequate dwellings, violence, lack of education, low income jobs, ineffective legal protection, vulnerability, exclusion or isolation.
In such a situation, several human rights of the elderly are being violated, such as human dignity, non-discrimination and equality, the right to adequate standard of living, the right to participation and social inclusion, the right to the highest possible standard of mental and physical health and others.

materials in reference to the elderly as a particularly vulnerable group.
The National Programme for Active Ageing focuses on, inter alia, support for lifelong learning, civic and social activities outside the formal labour market, support of independence, dignity, economic and social security of the elderly including the protection from ill-treatment in social areas and relations.
The aim of deinstitutionalisation of social services is to create and secure conditions for independent and free life of all persons dependent on help of the society in a natural social community environment, i.e. to prevent their separation and isolation from society in various institutions.
Deinstitutionalisation requires accessibility of good quality alternative services in public interest that would enable the persons concerned, including the elderly, to live free and independent life with the support of the community, experts, family members and volunteers.
As recipients of social services, the elderly are directly affected by deinstitutionalisation.
A National Framework Strategy for Supporting Social Inclusion and Fight against Poverty of 2015 is another important material in terms of the rights and social situation of the elderly, which lists the elderly as a group particularly vulnerable to poverty.
It is a strategic document summarising approaches to address poverty and social exclusion in Slovakia.
- observance of human rights and freedoms,
- procedural requirements,
- personal requirements,
- operation requirements.
The system of quality scoring of social services was supposed to be launched since 1.1.2016.
In 2016, the Centre in cooperation with the civic association Help the Elderly Forum (the Forum) followed up on their cooperation from 2008 and realised a research focusing on situation of the elderly in Slovakia.
The original research called Poverty and Social Exclusion of the Elderly81 realised in 2008 addressed the issue of poverty and social exclusion of the elderly and showed various interesting results.
Eight years later, the Centre and the Forum again engaged in cooperation in order to compare the results and assess changes in the monitored areas of life of the elderly.
The new Research on Poverty and Social Exclusion of the Elderly in Slovakia82 aimed to establish whether the situation of the elderly in various aspects of life has changed positively or negatively.
While in 2008 a percentage of Slovak population in the post-productive age was 12,1 %, by 2016 this number has grown to 14,5 %.
The research consisted of a questionnaire and covered all regions of Slovakia.
It targeted people over 53 years of age.
The Centre prepared the questionnaire and the Forum was responsible for gathering data from the respondents.
The Centre then recorded their answers in the electronic system and evaluated the results.
Altogether, the Forum gathered relevant answers from 786 respondents.
The research showed that the situation of the elderly in Slovakia is not easy.
Their monthly income is often very low and many of them are on the edge of poverty.
Fear of poverty is caused by low pensions, unexpected expenditures as well as dependence on others.
Without the help of children or a partner, many older persons would have serious problems to cover their monthly costs.
Fear from solitude or deterioration of health condition are everyday problems of the elderly.
Almost 90 % of respondents claimed that they did not have finances to cover their basic needs or that they could only cover them partially.
74,3 % respondents believe that the elderly are in danger of poverty, while almost 60 % respondents perceive themselves to be in

danger of poverty.
Women experience poverty more than men.
In terms of type of accommodation, people living in social care facilities fear poverty the most.
The risk of poverty is also linked to a persons income.
Almost 30 % respondents do not have sufficient finances to cover their basic needs.
More than 46 % respondents cannot cover their monthly costs and more than 15 % seniors must borrow money to get by.
Since 2008, monthly costs of a senior have raised from 308,51 € to 375,64 €.

Women feel the threat of poverty more than men (women 61,78 %, men 57,74 %).
The interest of seniors in active life, employment, culture and education has increased as compared to 2008, which is
Another obstacle is the lack of adaptation of the society to the needs of the elderly.
The society is often intolerant towards the elderly, full of stereotypes picturing older persons as incompetent, useless or impotent.
This results in discrimination based on age, which can occur in employment, health care and access to various forms of education.
According to the research, almost every second senior feels discriminated.
With regards to education, 20 % of seniors would be interested if they got the chance.
Interest of seniors in employment and education proves that they want to fully participate in the society.
Despite this, almost 70 % of the elderly claimed that they did not have equal opportunities to find employment as compared to people of other age categories.
Almost one fourth of the respondents stated that they regularly participated in cultural events.
The research Poverty and social exclusion of the elderly in Slovakia brought about crucial information on the situation of the elderly in Slovakia.
The results can serve for preparation of measures to improve this situation in order to secure full enjoyment of human rights by the elderly, including economic, social and cultural rights, without discrimination based on age.
The research also highlighted issues faced by the elderly in our society and its results raise awareness on these issues.
The Centre requested the selected central bodies of public administration and other relevant stakeholders to provide information on adopted or implemented TCM in 2016 or their cooperation in such projects.
Information on certain projects is not covered in this report since they have been analysed in previous HR Reports.
Besides that, the Centre has decided not to cover projects that do not
have all characteristic features of TCM, which used to be part of this chapter when reported
Hence, it can be concluded that the competent subjects still do not understand the concept of TCM.
8.1.1 Project Healthy Communities
Funding of the project is planned also after termination of funds allocated under the European Social Fund, within a contribution organisation Healthy Regions, i.e. from the state budget.
Sustainability of the project is crucial.
In order to achieve long lasting effects it is necessary to secure longer operation of health awareness assistants in MRC.
8.1.2 Projects within the package Take away
Its integral part are action plans.
83 Statement of the Ministry of Health concerning realised TCM in 2015 [quoted on 2017-03-03].
A new action plan for the years 2019 - 2020 is expected.
In 2016, the Roma Community Plenipotentiary continued with preparation activities for launching a Take away package, which unites several NP for Roma integration.
Municipalities with Roma communities living in worse life conditions were listed among those entitled.
Its specific aim is to increase integration of marginalised Roma in all areas of the society, including participation in the labour market.
Another project within the package is a NP Community centres in cities and municipalities with MRC I. The community centres would provide Roma and non-Roma citizens opportunities for joint social activities including informal education and leisure activities for children, youth and adults, assistance in community organising, conflict resolution and issues concerning housing, mutual relations as well as awareness raising and prevention activities.
These activities are beneficial in relation to increasing the chances in the labour market, social inclusion, prevention and resolution of inter-ethnical conflicts and pressure in municipalities with MRC.
In 2016, all three NP were in preparation stages, which included preparation of new job positions for field and social workers, awareness assistants, expert workers and expert workers for community centres.
It would be too early to evaluate the package since it was only at its preparation stage in 2016.
It can, however, be concluded that its projects target areas and have goals which create space for elimination of social exclusion of MRC and gradually eliminate their disadvantages and discrimination.
The Roma Community Plenipotentiary informed the Centre on funding of the project that indicates that the Take away package dispose of a significant amount of funds from the EU.
The work with MRC requires persistent, systematic and long-term activities in order to achieve positive results.
Preparation of the Take away package as well as background documentation thereto has taken a relatively long time and obviously considerable financial resources.
The Centre, thus, believes that the preparation stage would be completed soon and the practical implementation launched.
The Centre welcomes that the package includes a project for monitoring and evaluation of other projects, which can serve as an effective tool to secure effectivity of the projects.
8.1.3 Other supported projects for integration of the Roma minority
The Roma Community Plenipotentiary further informed the Centre that a call was launched by the Ministry of Interior to submit applications for a non-refundable financial contribution to support access to drinking water in separated and segregated MRC.
A TCM project called You also have a chance!
(Aj ty máš šancu!) continued also in 2016.
It consists of support for Roma high school students by providing free preparation
The ultimate goal of the project is that the students successfully graduate from EUBA and then find employment.
The project is based on personal support and assistance.
The project is organised by a civil association Centre for Research of Ethnicity and Culture (CVEK) in cooperation with EUBA.
In the academic year 2015/2016, four Roma students involved in the project started studying at EUBA.
They are the first successful applicants from the project.
These students keep studying also in the academic year 2016/2017.
CVEK claims that they settled down well at EUBA and several of them found a part-time jobs in accounting companies.
The project supports them by free tutoring in mathematics, statistics and English.
In 2016, three more Roma students from a Roma grammar school in Kremnica joined the project.
During preparations, one student decided to quit due to the level of difficulty.
Only one of the two remaining students successfully passed the entry exams.
The students were able to learn mathematics when it was properly explained to them.
The Roma Community Plenipotentiary provided information concerning the project Mentor and tutor assistance for Roma students at secondary schools organised by a Foundation Roma Education Fund, brand of an international foundation Roma Education Fund.
The Centre did not receive information on its results, number of students involved or form of assistance, and hence, it cannot evaluate the project.
- measures to promote upbringing and education of children from socially disadvantaged environment in day-long education system;
- measures to support gradual transition of students to secondary education through strengthening personal and expert capacities of upbringing and carrier consultants and supporting peer, mentor and tutor programmes;
- decreasing financial barriers to study at secondary schools and motivating students to further studies by scholarships for high achievement;
- strengthening expert and material resources for teaching Roma language and literature and supporting schools that teach this subject;
- securing qualified and sensitive diagnostics of Roma children and differentiating special upbringing and educational needs resulting from social disadvantage from those resulting from physical or mental disabilities;
Applicant for this call was a Methodical and pedagogical centre.
87 Statement the Roma Community Plenipotentiary regarding the realised TCM in 2016 [quoted on 2017-03-08].
88 Statement of the Ministry of Education regarding the realised TCM in 2016 [quoted on 2017-03-06].
90 The Centre does not have information regarding the realisation of the goal and concrete projects supported through this programme.
Education is one of the key areas of Roma integration.
It is positive that the project focuses already on pre-primary education of Roma children from MRC since these children often lack social habits and their enrolment in schools is usually problematic.
This influences their overall activity in educational institutions.
Generally, education affects social participation and employability.
The Centre would welcome more projects, similar to the CVEK's project You also have a chance!, that would focus also on lower levels of education.
8.1.5 Other projects in the area of education
The Ministry of Education provided information on a project Support of upbringing and education of students from a socially disadvantaged environment.
This project included call for applications for funding of development projects.
The Centre did not receive more detail information on supported projects, their goals and results.
The Ministry of Education further informed about the calls opened in 2016 regarding inclusive education.
These calls were roofed under a project More successful in a primary school, within which primary schools could apply for a non-refundable financial contribution
89 Statement of the Ministry of Interior regarding the realised TCM in 2016 [quoted on 2017-03-06].
Its priority is to improve equal access to lifelong learning for all age categories.
8.1.6 Grant programme Culture of disadvantaged groups of population
Target groups of this programme include:
- persons with disabilities (physical, intellectual, visual or hearing impairment including mental health - in line with CRPD);
- children and youth - particularly children from orphanages, children from MRC and child victims of violence;
- women (projects in the area of culture contributing to gender equality integration), e.g. non-discrimination of women over 45, single mothers, victims of violence, women from MRC, women in danger of poverty;
- people in danger of poverty and social exclusion, e.g. unemployed people, homeless people, members of socially excluded communities, LGBTI people, victims of human trafficking.
Although the Centre received information on supported projects and allocated sums for each particular group, it did not receive information on particular projects and those of them that are TCM.
8.1.7 Projects aimed at gender equality, equal opportunities for men and women and work-life balance
Information regarding projects aimed at elimination of discrimination based on gender and sex, including motherhood and parenthood, were provided by the Ministry of Labour.
In 2015 its HR Report, the Centre informed about the NP Family and work.
In 2016, upon evaluation of the projects within the ending Operational programme Employment and social inclusion, the Ministry of Labour started preparing for the continuation of a project with the same focus.
Projects will be supported through request-oriented projects instead of a NP.
Supported TCM or activities will include promotion of flexible care forms for children within the work-life balance and creation of effective tools to integrate mothers/parents with little children in the labour market after parental leave by promoting flexible job positions.
The project Support of balanced representation of women and men in leading positions in organisations of public and private sphere is funded under the European Commission grant scheme Progress.
In 2016, it was realised through three conferences and a competition for employers.
Low representation of women in managing positions in Slovakia is a long lasting problem and in the Bratislava Region women have a higher potential to build their career and reach higher and better-paid work positions.
However, only preparation works were done so far.
It is not very clear from the statement of the
The Ministry of Labour did not comment on the results of the original project Family and work.
In order to achieve real results in this area, it is crucial to implement more projects and activities.
In general, TCM are necessary and appropriate measures for Roma integration in Slovakia.
It is thus positive that relevant activities are being launched in this area, in particular the prepared NP Take away package.
The need for adoption of TCM is present with regards to other target groups apart from Roma, such as women.
Unfortunately, very few projects with long-term results are realised in this area.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Labour launched several preparation and support activities.
The Centre finds it negative that the majority of the projects are solely financed through EU funds.
Sustainability and permanence of project results is often questionable.
Regarding persons disadvantaged by their age (mainly seniors, the youth, graduates) and persons with disabilities, permanent measures are more appropriate.
TCM in employment area could be beneficial for young people and graduates who often face problems in finding employment.
The Centre has no knowledge about projects targeting groups other than Roma.
This is the only way to secure temporariness of TCM as measures required only for a certain period.
8.2 Research concerning the knowledge and use of TCM by territorial selfgovernment authorities
In 2016, the Centre realised the second phase of its research concerning the use of TCM by territorial self-governments.
Its main goal was to gather more information on adopted or recently prepared TCM, their content, period and effectivity.
Both parts of the research are evaluated in the Centre's publication Monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness of temporary compensatory measures in the Slovak Republic.
Another aim was to engage in closer cooperation with subjects adopting TCM.
An electronic questionnaire was distributed to 107 respondents and was filled out by 24,30 % of them.
Overall, 26 respondents participated in the second phase, one of which did not provide name of the municipality.
The residual 25 respondents covered 13 municipalities, 9 cities and 3 city parts.
The biggest number of participants was from Central Slovakia.
The questionnaire comprised 10 questions.
For instance, it asked about the period for TCM application, the disadvantaged group targeted or satisfaction with realisation and results of the project.
75 % respondents confirmed this.
A half of respondents stated that a TCM was adopted within a specific project.
Almost a half of them (46,15 %) realised TCM separately and 1 respondent did not provide information.
TCM were most commonly organised under the NP Field social work and the Operational programme Employment and social inclusion.
The most common goal was to integrate disadvantaged population, create job positions or create better conditions for seniors and persons with disabilities.
Bratislava: Slovenské národné stredisko pre ľudské práva, 2016. 90 p. ISBN 978-80-89016-86-0.
A majority of 88,46 % respondents are satisfied with realisation of TCM, only 3,85 % respondents were unsatisfied.
More than 70 % respondents confirmed that the project is still being implemented.
Remarkably, several respondents negated themselves.
The Centre recommends that:
2. The Ministry of Labour participate in various TCM projects aimed at equal opportunities for women in the labour market, including their greater promotion in leading and managing positions, in technical areas and involve the Bratislava Region in such activities.
3. The Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic and the organisation Healthy communities continue with the project Healthy communities and pay careful attention that health awareness assistants are not being missued beyond their work activities.
4. The Ministry of Education and other competent authorities support and realise TCM at all levels of education targeting the Roma minority.
5. The Roma Community Plenipotentiary launch the package Take away and pay due attention to the highest effectiveness in using the allocated financial resources.
6. All subjects adopting TCM follow up on previously implemented and realised TCM when adopting new TCM targeting the same disadvantaged group.
7. All subjects adopting TCM fulfil their reporting duty towards the Centre and notify it about adopted TCM in line with the Antidiscrimination Act.
IMPACTS OF CHICANE
Within its equality body mandate the Centre provides legal aid to victims of discrimination.
In the recent years, the Centre monitors the increasing number of complaints concerning chicane in workplace either in the form of bossing, mobbing or other forms.
Negative work conditions, stress and inappropriate workload that can lead to psychosocial diseases cause in certain cases discrimination.
9.1 Psychosocial diseases and their impact on labour activity
The issue of psychosocial diseases is a negative trend developing as a result of chicane in workplace.
A psychosocial disease is a psychological disadvantage that, together with other barriers, creates space for development of a disability.
The Centre is particularly concerned by those manifestations that result in discrimination in the workplace and chicane behaviour of superior workers or colleagues, which causes diseases based on psychosocial burdens.
9.2 Psychosocial diseases - term and related issues
Primarily, these diseases occur due to environmental impacts, the so-called psychosocial risks, which result in concrete psychosocial diseases.
Psychosocial risks include high workload, monotonous work, unclear expectations concerning work performance, risk of violence etc.
Distortion of reality perception together with other barriers causes deficits such as depression, anxiety, phobias, bad eating habits and others.
Working individuals can show symptoms of aggressiveness, chicane, pathological addictions, sexual dysfunctions, suicidal behaviour etc.
The Slovak legal order covers several legal measures for protection from risks that could lead to psychosocial diseases.
Equal treatment of persons with disabilities and its protection is regulated by the Antidiscrimination Act in the areas of employment, social security, health care, provision of goods and services as well as education.
European and international legislation
Pursuant to CRPD and Optional Protocol thereto, all persons with any type of disability shall enjoy human rights and freedoms equally with other persons.
New technologies, materials and work processes applied in workplace can also affect work conditions as they change work quality and established work habits.
Ways these concrete forms of development enter into working life can directly affect employers.
In terms of stress, it must be noted that it becomes a risk only when having a long-term character.
Chicane in the workplace represents an abuse of rights in labour relations.
Unfortunately, the Labour Code does not define this term.
Forms of chicane are bossing, mobbing and staffing.
9.5 Research presented at the legal seminar in Brussels (25.11.2016)
The 2014 Eurobarometer showed that 27 % of health problems is caused by stress, depressions and anxieties.
Such behaviour is typical by labelling, segregation and discrimination of workers and causes psychosocial diseases.
Overall, 22 % of women and 19 % of men in the EU face adverse work conditions due to working under psychosocial distortions.

1 Gender Equality tEJ,
Gender equality is an interdisciplinary term without exact definition in either Slovak legal order or in international law.
Generally, the gender equality can be defined as equal opportunities between men and women, boys and girls.
2 The concept of gender equality is more precisely developed by the UN Women that defines gender equality mainly as “equal rights, obligations and opportunities of men and women, boys and girls”.3 On the national level, the Nationwide Strategy for Gender Equality in the Slovak Republic for the years 2014 - 2019 defines gender equality in the Slovak Republic as an equal social status of men and women in all spheres of public and private life aiming at securing the full social potential in accordance with individual skills.
The objective of the gender equality is not men and women becoming the same but that the obligations and responsibilities of men and women would not depend on the gender someone was born with.
It can be said that concerning individual interests, specific needs, life situations and priorities of men and women, the gender equality takes also into consideration the difference between sexes.
The gender equality is not only a human rights issue but it can be also seen as a condition and indicator of sustainable development.
In recent years, the gender equality has become a popular topic of discussion in the society.
The popularity of gender equality brings not only positives but also negatives caused by its misinterpretation.
Gender equality should not be equated or interchanged with, for instance, feminism.
In comparison with gender equality, feminism is characterised as a certain intellectual obligation or political movement that strives to achieve social justice for women and/or fights against sexism.
On the international level, there are multiple international treaties and conventions regulating the gender equality.
Many of these international treaties and conventions were also signed and ratified by the Slovak Republic.
The most important international convention in the field of protection of the gender equality is considered the 1979 International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination of Women (hereinafter the “CEDAW”) and its optional protocol.
5 Many of these conventions regulate the gender equality (resp. equal treatment principle) as an accessory rights bound to other “priority” right.
In the Slovak Republic, there is no legal definition of gender equality nor an independent legal regulation of gender equality.
Gender equality is regulated by laws concerning the equal treatment principle - non-discrimination.
The most important laws regulating the equal treatment principle is considered ADL.
However, the Labour Code and other laws having provisions on equality6 must be also stipulated.
The promotion, protection and development of gender equality in the Slovak Republic is mainly carried out by the Centre as an independent equality body and by Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “Ministry of Labour”) - the Department of Gender Equality and Equal Opportunities and by the Committee for Gender Equality as a permanent advisory committee of the Council of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Human Rights, National Minorities and Gender Equality which is responsible for monitoring the observance and implementation of the CEDAW, other international human rights conventions, legislation and strategic goals of the EU in this field.
In 2014, the Government of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “Government”) adopted the Nationwide Strategy for Gender Equality in the Slovak Republic for years 2014 2019 proposed by the Ministry of Labour.
According to the Ministry of Labour, the
5 e.g. European Convention on Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in the field of education - UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, in the field of child protection - Convention on the Rights of Child or in the field of employment rights - Convention of International Labour Organisation on Equal Remuneration of Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value, Convention of International Labour Organisation concerning Discrimination in Respect to Employment and Occupation.

- traditional distribution of gender roles;
- insufficient knowledge of rights and gender equality agenda;
- lack of temporary countervailing measures;
- lack of services for better work-life balance.
1.1 Gender Equality Index and Gender Inequality Index
Gender Equality/ Inequality Index is an indicator which reflects the status and level of gender equality in an individual country or region.
Two indexes on gender equality are a part of this report, namely:
a) gender development index;
b) gender inequality index.
While gender development index takes into consideration mainly data such as life expectancy, expected years of schooling, standard of living of men and women, the gender inequality index takes into the consideration a different portfolio of indicators:
Together, these indicators form female empowerment index and male empowerment index.
9 Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic: „Nationwide Strategy for Gender Equality in the Slovak Republic for the Years 2014 - 2019“(2014), p. 13 - 21.
c) In the field of labour, it consider male and female labour force participation.
After the evaluation of the global index of gender inequality, the Slovak Republic ranked 40th with 0,991 points and reached very high level of human development.
To compare, Austria ranked 24th place (0.078 points), Czech Republic ranked 28th place (0.129 points), Poland ranked in 36th place (0.137 points) and Hungary ranked 43rd place (0.252 points).12
On the other hand, EIGE focuses on the empowerment of all aspects of gender equality on the level of the EU.
Through the gender equality index, it measures level of the gender equality in individual EU member states and monitors the development of gender equality on the EU level in accordance with its individual established policies.
13 The gender equality index is based on data collected in eight different areas of human life:
a) work;
b) money;
c) knowledge;
d) time;
e) status;
f) health;
g) violence; and
h) intersecting inequalities.
After evaluation of the results of the EIGE's gender equality index, it can be stated that the level of gender equality in the Slovak Republic has been stagnating for a long time.
When looking at the evaluation of individual areas of human life, the Slovak Republic has achieved the best
13 European Institute for Gender Equality: “Gender Equality Index: Data” (2015), available online at http://eige.europa.eu/gender-equality-index.
14 European Institute for Gender Equality: “Gender Equality Index: About the Index” (2015), available online at http://eige.europa.eu/gender-equality-index/about.
results in the area of health (85.3 points), finances (74 points) and labour (65.5 points).16 However, in comparison with previous years, the Slovak Republic has accomplished better results only in the field of finance.
17 On the other hand, the worst results were achieved by the Slovak Republic in the field of violence (30 points) and empowerment (23.1 points).
When evaluating data collected in the Slovak Republic, EIGE took into the consideration following indicators:
a) In the field of labour: participation (mainly FTE employment rates and duration of working life) along with segregation and quality of work (mainly ability to take one hour or two off during working hours to take care of personal or family matters, career prospect index).
b) In the field of money: financial resources (mainly mean monthly earnings and mean equivalised net income) and economic situation (mainly not at-risk-ofpoverty and income distribution).
e) In the field of health: status (mainly self-perceived health, good or very good, life expectancy at birth, healthy life years at birth), behaviour (mainly people who don't smoke and are not involved in harmful drinking and people doing physical activities and/or consuming fruits and vegetable) and access (mainly population without unmet needs for medical and dental examination).
Measuring and monitoring the gender equality on multiple levels (UN, EU and national level) allows the Government not only adequately and independently evaluate the situation in the Slovak Republic but, in accordance with the results of individual monitoring and measuring, to adapt the Nationwide Strategy of the Gender Equality in the Slovak Republic and respective national action plans to gradually eliminate inequalities between man/boys and women/girls in all areas of their life.
New goals and targets came into force on 1 January 2016.
- to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the private and public sphere, including human trafficking, sexual and other forms of exploitation,
- to eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation,

1. Silver and Circular Economy
2. Education
3. Health, Environment and Quality of Life
The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees defines gender based violence and sexual violence as a violence directed against a person based on the gender.
The Criminal Code (hereinafter the “CC”) as a fundamental legal act of substantive criminal law includes multiple definitions of various kinds of violence,
including those types of violence which can be subsumed under the category of gender based violence as well as violence against women.
Moreover, in August 2017, as proposed by the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “Ministry of Justice”), the Government adopted the resolution No. 379 dated 16.8.2017 by which the ratification of the Istanbul Convention was postponed indefinitely.
The Ministry of Justice was ordered to monitor the development of public opinion and moderate the discussion on the Istanbul Convention.
The Government substantiated this decision by the fact that some of the provision of the Istanbul Convention might be deemed controversial and inconsistent with the Slovak Constitution.
1.2.1 Campaign “Because I said no (Pretože hovorím nie)”
In accordance with the respective national action plan, in 2017, the Ministry of Labour launched an awareness raising and information campaign on sexual violence - “Because I said no”.
The Campaign is aiming at increasing the sensitivity of young people to the matters of sexual violence and to refuse it publicly.
27 The campaign is a reaction to the results of the 2016 Eurobarometer whereby 47 % of respondents consider gender based or sexual violence justifiable under certain circumstances.
Slovak respondents consider being such circumstances:
c) wearing revealing, provocative or sexy clothing (16%); and
This can be mostly concluded based on the number of views of the video

1.2.2 National Helpline for Women Experiencing Violence
In 2015, the historically first Slovak national non-stop helpline providing women experiencing violence help and support was established.
The helpline is aiming at minimalizing the risks which are faced by women in a violent relationship and ensuring necessary help to women whose access to information is difficult due to disability or other handicap.
National Helpline for Women Experiencing Violence (hereinafter the “National Helpline”) is operated by the Ministry of Labour.
In 2017, the National Helpline recorded 3 301 calls of which 2821 calls (85%) having average duration of 6 minutes were answered.
32 In comparison with previous years (2015 and 2016), the decrease in the occupancy rate of the National Helpline can be observed.
The clients were calling once or multiple time depending on their needs, the extent of exposure to violence and provided intervention.
35 The National Helpline provides women with safe and anonymous space for talk about the experienced violence.

Two most experienced types of violence are psychological violence which is experienced by 299 out of 392 clients of the National Helpline (79%) and physical violence which is experienced by 222 clients (57%).
In accordance with the data provided by the Ministry of Labour, the other forms of violence recorded through the calls to the National Helpline are social, economic and sexual violence.
Moreover, the operators of the National Helpline also identified 128 cases of dangerous threats and 57 cases of dangerous chasing.
Apart from the statistics of the National Helpline, the violence against women in the Slovak Republic can be also monitored through the statistics of the Police Corps of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “Police Corps”) which relates to individual crimes.

perpetrators.
The Centre also requested information from relevant non-profit organisations and civic associations which, during their activities, are in contact with women experiencing violence or who experienced violence or are providing such women with help and support.
Out of 9 requested organisations, only two organisations provided the Centre with information about their activities related to the violence against women - civic association Woman in Need and Civic Association Helping Family.
In 2017, the civic association Woman in Need received 87 complaints, the complaints about experienced physical and psychological violence
36 From the answer of the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic to the questions of the Centre dated 15 February 2018.
39 It can be concluded that the civic association Woman in Need has recorded a very moderate decline in the number of complaints.
In comparison with 2017, the Women in Need received 10 complaints less than in 2016.
Equal representation of women and men is an important precondition of effective democracy and good governance of public matters.
The advantages of actual equality between women and men in political life are more just society, inclusive administration, higher living standards, and positive impact on development of education, healthcare and infrastructure as well as declining level of political corruption.
The underlining cause of low representation of women in political life are gender stereotypes.
Gender stereotypes predict that the basic characteristics of a good leader, including political one, are assertiveness, dominance, rationality, therefore the characteristics attributable to men.
Another reason of unsatisfactory participation of women in political life are also political parties.
The political parties are usually domain of man who, by control of party functions and lists of candidates, create a barrier to further penetration of women to politics.
Political parties and their leaders do not play often active role when promoting the political participation of women and their attitudes towards the voluntary quotas or other forms of measures increasing the number of women participating in political decision-making varies.
In 2017, there was no political party chaired by a women in the Slovak Republic.
If it comes to parliamentary clubs, two out of seven parliamentary clubs are chaired by women.
39 From the answer of the civic association Woman in Need to questions of the Centre dated 22 January 2018
40 From the answer of the civic association Helping Family to questions of the Centre dated 22 January 2018
Overall, the Slovak Republic was placed on 74th place.
43 Political participation of women is therefore worse in comparison with the overall placement of the country.
To compare, in 2013 the Slovak republic was also placed on 74th place but in the category of political participation of women achieved 77th place out of 136 countries.
44 Similarly unfavourable is the position of the Slovak Republic in the 2015 Gender Equality Index drafted by EIGE.
In the category of political strength of women, the Slovak Republic received only 29 points out of 100 points while the EU average is 48.5 points.
When evaluating criteria for the determination of political strength of women, the index focuses on the ratio of female ministers, female members of national parliament and female member of regional parliaments.

The equality of women and men in regard to the participation in political and public life is guaranteed by international conventions on the protection of human rights.
In accordance with Article 3, the states are bound to ensure the equal right of men and women to enjoyment of these political rights.
General recommendations to Article 23 of the CEDAW highlights the need for temporary countervailing measures (hereinafter “TCM”) (e.g. quotas) to ensure the equality of women and men in participation in public life and politics.
To ensure the actual equality in politics is necessary, not only formally, to remove obstacles as well as introduce temporary measures supporting equal participation of women and men in public life.
46 See the UN Committee for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: „General Recommendation No. 23 - Politics and Public Life ”(1997), available online at
As an examples, the legal quotes are mentioned.
In 1995, the Beijing Declaration in its Article 13 named the full participation women in accordance with the equal treatment principle in all spheres of society, including decision making processes, to be fundamental when achieving equality, development and peace.
The resolution of the European Parliament on Women in Political Decision-Making: Quality and Equality49, which call upon the member states and EU institutions to propose and implement effective gender equality policies and strategies to achieve parity participation in political decision-making and leadership on all level, is considered a key document in the EU system.
In the declaration, there are gender quotas included amongst the tools for achievement of this goal.
The gender policies on the EU level follow the Strategic Engagement of the Gender Equality for the years 2016 - 2019,50 which also stipulates the need for achieving the gender balance in political decision-making and the support of activities of national governments which are backing gender balance in political and public decision-making.
To conclude, the conclusions of the Council of the European Union on European Pack for Gender Equality for the Period 2011 - 202051 are calling for the measures on a national level and, if appropriate, on

The Slovak Constitution in its Article 30 enshrines general, equal and direct voting right and access to elected and other offices for all citizens under the same conditions.
Within this goal, one of the tasks aims at increasing the representation of women in decisionmaking positions in political life, including their motivation and possibility to run for an office and participate.
The Centre conducted an analysis of the election to the bodies of self-governing regions (hereinafter the “SGR Elections”) in 2017 from the perspective of representation of men and women.
The Analyses focused on male and female candidate running for the post of chair of the chairman/ chairwomen of the self-governing region (hereinafter “SGR”) as well as for on the candidates running for members of the council of the higher territorial unit.
The results of the analysis clearly show a low participation of women in the SGR elections and low proportion of representation of women on the posts of SGR chairwoman.
All over the Slovak Republic, there were 92 candidates to the post of chairperson of SGR out of which only 9 were female candidates.
From all male and female candidates running for the post of SGR chairperson, there were only 9.78% of female candidates.
In the SGR Bratislava, there were overall 11 persons, out of which 2 were female candidates that is 11.11% of all running candidates.
In the SGR Košice, there were 15 candidates out of which only one was a woman that is 6.67% of all running candidates.
In the SGR Nitra, there were 8 candidates out of which only one was a woman that is 12.5% all running candidates.
In the SGR Prešov, there were 12 candidates, none of which was a woman.
In the SGR Trenčín, there were 7 candidates, out of which three were women that is 42.86% of all running candidates.
In the SGR Trnava, there were 6 candidates and, just like in the SGR Prešov, there was no female candidate.
In the SGR Žilina, there were 9 candidates, out of which one was a woman that is 11.11 % of all running candidates.
The highest number of female candidates were running in the SGR Trenčín (three persons) while in SGR Prešov and Trnava, there was no female candidate.
From all persons elected to the office of chairpersons of SGR, there is only one woman what represents 12.5% of all chairpersons of SGRs.
The proportion of elected women to the post of a chairwoman of SGR is 2.79% higher than the ration of women running for the office of chairwomen of SGR.

It is positive that in comparison with the year 2013, a woman was elected to the office of the chairperson of the SGR.
In 2017, the number of women running for the spot in the SGR assemblies was higher as well as the overall proportion of male and female candidates was higher.
In 2013, the overall number of female candidates was 485 what is 18.83% of all running candidates.
In 2017, the overall number of female candidates was 615 what is 21.19% of all running candidates.
Despite this positive trend, the number of women sitting in the SGR assemblies is lower than after the 2013 SGR elections.
Negative discrepancy between the elected female members of SGR assemblies in 2013 and 2017 is subject to further research.
Therefore, the finding of the Centre in 2017 are based on its own work in this field.
The Centre considers the fact that the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic has not provided general and expert public with freely accessible data divided and structured in respect to the gender negatively.
Division of the statistical data not only in respect to the gender but also in respect to age, level of income, education and geographical location represents a key tool for detecting deep structural inequalities in the society.
Using such divided statistical data is highly recommended by the UN, also within the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development.

The Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic and political parties adopt temporary countervailing measures aiming at reaching the actual equality of women in political life and in decision-making positions in political life.
Political parties introduce initiatives allowing the full participation of women in politics on the national, regional and local level.
Political parties implement mentoring programmes aiming at the higher participation of women in politics on the national, regional and local levels.
The Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic implements a precise division of collection and disclosure of statistical data pursuant to the standards of the UN.
The Centre has been consistently monitoring situation concerning housing of Roma.
In its 2015 Human Rights Report, the Centre points out the pertaining problem with Roma housing situation.
According to the Atlas of Roma Communities in Slovakia, in 2013, there were 29 406 dwellings in 803 monitored settlements with estimated population of 215 436 persons.
The most common type of dwellings were flats in blocks of flats with a total number of 10 635 (36.2 %) and with estimated population of 66 400 persons (29.7 % of population in all dwellings).
The second most frequent type of dwellings were legal concrete houses, e.g. houses registered in the land registry, with a total number of 8 701 and an estimated population of 72 083 persons (33.5 % of population in all dwellings).
Legal huts and houses constructed upon construction permit (e.g. legal individual houses) represented 9 889 (33.6 %) dwellings with an estimated population of 79 187 people (36.8 % of population in all dwellings).54
It is a common fact that Roma often live in dwellings that do not fulfil technical and hygiene standards, lack access to drinking water, electricity, gas, canalisation, roads or lack of pavements with public street lighting.
These dwellings are in many cases constructed over lands that do not have legally settled ownership or lands of known owners without their consent.
They also live in destroyed blocks of flats from the previous regime or one-room provisional huts made of various materials.
A socialistic program for liquidation of Roma settlements started creation of these destroyed streets or neighbourhoods, which are indeed uncomplimentary for the cities concerned.
Back then, population of these settlements was resettled to flats in cities facing challenges, lack of will or abilities of Roma to use properly such new dwellings.
Roma from socially disadvantaged environments could not adapt to living in flats and it was precisely the lack of understanding of Roma ethno-psychology that often lead to complete demolition or depreciation of these flats by Roma.
The majority society affected by prejudice, stereotypes and media tend to believe that the situation in Roma settlements is unsolvable.
It must, however, be underpinned that the
situation concerning housing of Roma cannot be seen superficially.
Hence, it is impossible to create a single model to be implemented nationwide.
Regarding the institutional segregation, it must also be noted that certain Slovak cities resettle maladaptive Roma families from city centres to outskirts with flats for late payers as part of their public policies.
This is exactly how Roma enclaves and poor enclaves were created consequently leading to ghettoization of Roma.
A tendency not to have less adaptive Roma present in those parts considered valuable by the majority society, such as city centres and nearby areas or close to touristic localities, is a general effort in Slovak cities.
The amendment of this act was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “Ministry of Agriculture”) addressing the need to settle ownership rights and rights of use concerning the lands under settlements of marginalised Roma communities (hereinafter the “MRC”) as well as lands in farmyards.
Regarding the lands under settlements, the amendment entitles the landowners and co-owners to opt for settlement in a form of new lands, lands under settlements or monetary settlement.
Roma have been the most negatively assessed group in Slovakia concerning social distance.
58 Research conducted in the area confirm that negative attitudes towards Roma pertain
Bratislava”(2015), Department of Politics of Matica Slovenská
58 Social distance from Roma means the proportion of respondents that rejects Roma as neighbours or rejects Roma in their city/municipality/country.
at all levels of the society.
The level of social distance depends on the age, gender, education, social and economic activities and status.
The majority lacks sufficient objective information on Roma and does not understand structural causes of their situation.
Roma are perceived as unchangeable and unsolvable, even as a threat.
The same proportion applies for segregated settlements with a total number of 9 756 dwellings inhabited by 73 920 residents as estimated.
Settlements within municipalities have a total population of 46 496 inhabitants with the lowest number of dwellings (7 210) and the lowest proportion of residents per dwellings - 6.5 residents.
The Centre believes that in those cities and municipalities that implement measures for Roma these are ultimately beneficial for all inhabitants.
Success of such cities and municipalities is due to incredible efforts of mayors who are willing to make steps ahead to resolve the so called Roma issue.
CERD also pays attention to housing situation of Roma minority.
It recommends the Slovak Government improve living conditions of socially excluded members of Roma minority and eliminate their segregation in housing.
The Centre upholds concluding observations of CERD.
When selecting particular case studies, the Centre sought to show diversity of

approaches of cities and municipalities towards housing of Roma.
There is a fully segregated Roma settlement close to Budulovská Street with two blocks of flats (24 flats).
These flats are owned by their residents and have access to electricity.
Due to debts on payments, they lack access to drinking water.
Roma living in these streets live in houses with access to electricity, water, canalisation and possibility of gas connection.
Finally, some Roma communities are scattered within the majority society in Rožňavská Street, Bartalošová Street, Tehelná Street, Jesenského Street, ČSA Street and Obrancov Mieru Street.
Roma flats in Rožňavská Street, ČSA Street and Bartalošová Street and Roma houses in the remaining streets have access to electricity, water and canalisation.
Pursuant to information in media, in 2017, Moldava nad Bodvou decided to sell approximately 20 flats in Rožňavská Street inhabited by Roma families who had debts on rent towards the city.
According to the statement of the city, this was a solution of long lasting problems concerning citizens damaging rented city property and breaching lease contracts, hence the city refuses any manifestations of discrimination.
63 Members of the city council
62 City of Moldava n ad Bodvou: “Programme of Development of the City of Moldava nad Bodvou for the Years
approved the sale of flats in December 2016.
The explanatory note of the city states that the tenants concerned were also “maladaptive inhabitants” and that cohabitation of tenants and owners of flats has not always been ideal.
The city enters into lease agreements for a period of one year and at the end of the year regularly evaluates them by a housing committee and housing administrators.
It also states that currently it was not in such economic situation to build dozens low-standard flats due to disproportionate increase of debts as well as weak support of state housing policies.
The statement of the city of Moldava nad Bodvou regarding the Centre's application further mentions two requests for transfer of ownership to flats in indefinite lease.
There were no such requests concerning other flats in definite lease.
These agreements were approved in 2016 at the 25 th session of the city council.
Consequently, the original tenants could request to buy their flats, which was done by 9 of them who bought the flats from the city.
The remaining flats were not sold and are used by their original tenants.
The city underlined, that the amount of debts of these 11 tenants was more than EUR 100 000 by the end of 2017.

Separate entrances to each school formed part of this consensus due to the need to set up clear competences under the assets management, mainly to maintain order, justified costs aimed at assets protection and prevention of possible liability in case of health damage of children or other citizens.
66 It claimed that the fence was built upon request of parents of children of the Primary School at Československej armády Street since previously strangers used to enter the areal.
These people disrupted education, entered the dining hall and there were even occurrences of attacks and theft.
Media published information according to which the headmaster of the Primary School with Grammar School with Hungarian as Teaching Language, however, had not handle any written complaint or dealt with any situation concerning attacks or thefts.
It must be noted that several issues have accumulated in Moldava nad Bodvou and these cannot be resolved separately.

In 2017, the Centre conducted an independent investigation69 concerning refusal of entry for people of Roma ethnicity to public swimming pools in Moldava nad Bodvou and concluded discriminatory action of employees of the public swimming pools70.
On the other hand, it must be stated that the self-government cooperates with the Office of the Plenipotentiary of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Roma Communities and field social work is one of the city's priorities.
The Apostolic Church in Sabinov71 plans to create a “model street” for interested Roma.
Urbanistic study of the Apostolic Church estimates construction of approximately 20 new houses for Roma families at the outskirts of Sabinov.
The main goal of this project is that the future users build the houses from their own resources and on their own lands.
As a precondition, Roma themselves had to buy the lands and the Apostolic Church subsequently requested the city of Sabinov to change the land plan so that these Roma could start the construction.
However, residents of a nearby street objected since they were worried that their living standards and housing in the area would deteriorate.
The city council consequently withdrew the issue from the agenda.

Changes and supplements concerned 20 localities, first of which reflects the request of the Apostolic Church in Slovakia- Sabinov and concerns the area “IBV Malá Hura” opposite the church of the Apostolic Church.
Despite this change did not raise from the initiative of the city, the city adopted it and did not request the Apostolic Church to cover the costs for procuring the landplaning documentation.
Resulting from the statement of the city of Sabinov, modification of the land plan in the area was not definitely rejected but only moved to a separate debate to be held later.
Representatives of the Apostolic Church in Sabinov believe that concerns of people are exaggerated.
It defends the project of the so called Roma Street by stating that the new houses would be constructed by their owners without any donations.
The city of Sabinov states that it had met several times with representatives of the Apostolic Church and it has been trying to address and solve the issue of the Apostolic Church.
Prejudice rate of the majority towards Roma remains high in Slovakia.
Media often picture Roma inappropriately and unprofessionally, which only leads to further stereotyping and sets grounds for discrimination.
Regarding the planned construction in Hura, racial hatred is manifested mainly against the Roma population due to generalisation, stereotyping and creation of stereotypes concerning their behaviour, values and customs.
The Centre welcomes communication between the representatives of the city and the Apostolic Church as well as field social work of the city of Sabinov in the area of housing, in particular assistance in legalisation of unlawful constructions and filing applications for electricity connection, water connections and applications for rented flats.

The construction was organised by the city with a loan from the State Housing Development Fund, donation from the Ministry of Transport and Construction of the Slovak Republic (hereinafter the “Ministry of Transport”) and its own resources.
In the block A18, there are 18 flats with 80 residents, block B28 has 28 flats with 140 residents and block C28 has 28 flats with 179 residents.
New lowstandard flats are equipped with sanitary, kitchen unit and solid fuel furnace.
At its session on 7 June 2017, the Social, Health and Housing Committee of the City Council in Svidník assessed the applications for low-standard rental flats lease and passed those applicants who fulfilled requirements under the generally binding regulation into selection by toss.
According to the statement of Svidník, the city assisted the citizens with moving.
It also provides assistance in filing applications, regarding requirements for allocation of flats in other localities where the majority and minority cohabitate.
This concern flats in Nábrežná Street with 32 families and flats in Sovietskych hrdinov Street with 26 families.
The city also stated that many families live in houses all around Svidník.
These are integrated families, their members have jobs and took responsibility for their lives.
Social Housing, as amended.
The Centre welcomes that the city of Svidník implements social housing in practice.
One of the municipalities comprehensively approaching work with Roma communities is Spišský Hrhov, where 350 of 1 800 citizens are Roma.
The current mayor, Mr. Vladimír Ledecký, has been a mayor since 1998, when Roma still lived in huts without electricity, almost all of them were unemployed and one fifth of children attended special schools.
At the beginning, the municipality adopted a strategic plan of municipality, analysing situation and proposing solutions, timeframe and resources.
The whole planning process was conducted with participation of citizens including Roma, the city council, professional facilitators and academics.
e. the effort for maximum possible integration of Roma community within the municipality and overall development of the municipality, remains.
Housing problems were identified as one of the most serious within preparation of strategic development.
79 Spišský Hrhov became the first Slovak municipality to adopt a plan of economic and social development.
All activities and plans of the municipal enterprise80 are in line with the strategic plan of municipal development.
The municipal enterprise also built rental flats for them in a concrete block with 6 flats and wooden houses with 5 flats.

81 From the answer of the city of Spišský Hrhov to the questions of the Centre dated 16 February 2018.
Primary activities of the municipality focused on culture of living, housekeeping, hygiene and cohabitation.
Further activates aimed at aesthetics of external premises of houses, house yards, entrances and maintenance of public areas.
The municipality addressed and implemented a system of tax and commission duties' observance by real households' members.
A system of waste collection and export, elimination of dumpsites and streets pollution, particularly a system of illegal dumpsites.
Spišský Hrhov is special for activities of its municipal enterprise.
It mainly focuses on construction, provision of municipal swimming pools, construction and management of distillery, landscape maintenance, fruits and herbs drying, cleaning services, briquettes and pallets production, organisation of festivals, cultural and social events.
The municipal enterprise offers its craftsmen to other municipalities and firms in return for consideration.
Profits of the municipal enterprise divides into the needs of its development and other social services in the municipality.
The municipal enterprise has secured more than half of construction works of flats while future tenants directly participated.
Pursuant to the statement of Spišský Hrhov, all lands in the municipality have settled ownership and there are no unlawful constructions.
A key factor behind the current situation was lands buyout from their original owners by the mayor for affordable prizes.

The Centre recommends that:
01. Self-governing regions develop clear housing policies aimed at elimination of segregation.
02. Self-governing regions improve housing conditions of Roma through social work.
04. Self-governing regions increase proportion of Roma dwellings with access to basic infrastructure.
05. Self-governing regions and the Ministry of Transport and Construction of the Slovak Republic increase proportion of Roma citizens living in lawful dwellings and on lands with settled ownership.
06. The Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic and the Legal Aid Centre provide free legal aid against forced evictions, threats of evictions and demolition.
This cooperation focuses on the rights of children with special education and upbringing needs and on implementation of conditions for inclusive education of children from socially excluded background.
SSI informed the Centre on relevant facts established during school inspections.
Upon the Centre's request, SSI provided complex reports with results of school inspections in all three schools and reports from follow-up inspections monitoring adoption of imposed measures with regards to two of them (Giraltovce and Hurbanovo).
The Centre conducted personal visits at the schools.
The aim of personal visits was to monitor current situation in the school year 2017/2018, visit of the school during education and mainly to personally interview leadership of the schools (headmasters and deputy headmasters).
The interviews aimed to establish current situation concerning segregation findings of SSI and gain closer information about historical development of the current situation in terms of discrimination and future perspectives.
Cases of segregation in education regularly occur in Slovakia and it is not expected that this would change in the close future.
Discrimination and segregation occur whenever organisation of education breaches principles regulated by state and basic goals of upbringing and education in relation to the principle of equal treatment.
In terms of full acceptance of principles of inclusive education, desegregation and the need not to discriminate children from MRC, the Centre underlines that real abilities of municipalities and cities to mitigate the situation with nothing more than their own efforts should be considered.
Financial resources allocated by the Slovak government in the years 2013 - 2016 for capacity increase of primary schools through construction, extension, superstructure, modernisation and reconstruction of school objects in the amount of EUR 7,243 million covered creation of 263 new classes for approximately 6 575 pupils.
Dozens of schools, hundreds of classes and thousands of pupils educated in two-shift organisation keep waiting for new premises.
Apart from spatial capacities, increased resources for school assistants (the Ministry of Education currently approves approximately 50 % of the applications), special pedagogues, psychologists and speech therapists are also needed.
In terms of this, the Centre welcomes the activity of the Ministry of Education which, as intermediary for priority axe Education under Operational Programme Human Resources, in 2017 launched a call for applications for non-repayable financial contribution to support inclusive education “More successful at primary school” (OPLZ-PO1/2016/DOP/1.1.1-01).
Eligible applicants under the call included:
b) primary school founder if a particular school does not have its own legal personality,
c) primary schools for pupils with health disadvantages with regards to creation of job position for teacher assistants for pupil with health disadvantage.
3.1 Terňa Primary School with Nursery School
SSI - School Inspection Centre Prešov conducted a school inspection in Terňa Primary School with Nursery School between 2 November 2016 and 8 November 2016.
The report from
In this building, education was organised also in the afternoon for pupils from MRC.
Such organisation of education showed segregation features.
In 1961, the primary school in Terňa moved to its current premises and originally had 14 classes with one class for each year in the first grade and two classes for each year in the second grade.
The increased number of pupils in the second grade took into account influx of pupils after completing first grade education in the so called small classes schools in surrounding municipalities within Terňa school district.
Altogether, 193 pupils have special upbringing and educational needs, 44 pupils due to health disadvantages and 149 pupils come from socially disadvantaged background.
Approximately 65 % of all pupils come from MRC.
The primary school with nursery school consists of two buildings, the main one and an adjacent building originally built by a municipality to serve as nursery school.
The school justified division of pupils in parallel classes by the need of optimisation in the interest of both groups.
Criteria for division are based on previous attendance of nursery school.
One class is comprised of pupils with pre-school education in nursery school (belonging to majority and MRC), the second class comprises pupils who are mostly without prior education and have increased need to develop communication and grapho-motoric skills and improve communication in Slovak.
Disposable hours are allocated differently in parallel classes, taking into account abilities and needs of pupils.
In parallel classes, education of English is enhanced by more hours allocated from disposable hours in terms of abilities and quality education (in the 7th year, education of Russian as second foreign language is similarly enhanced).88
During the Centre's visit, situation in the school was practically the same as described in the report of SSI.
Hence, there is no single class only comprising pupils from the majority population in the school.
In the main building, classes have both pupils from the majority and those from MRC (with permanent residence in Terňa or Malý Slivník).
These pupils attended pre-school education in nursery school or were re-enrolled from parallel classes in higher years of the first grade.
The main barriers are insufficient funding for support staff in the school and limited premises available.
The school opened one nursery school class to satisfy the increased demand of parents from Terňa for pre-school education of their children, which caused organisation of afternoon education in classes located in the adjacent building.
Every day, approximately 20 pupils from MRC of Furmanec settlement fail to present themselves at the school, arrive late by car with their parents or by feet.
Four assistants of pupils work in the school, two of them are Roma.
Due to insufficient financial resources, these assistants do not have permanent contracts but conduct works on agreement or under graduate practice programme.
None of the local primary schools has capacities to enrol children from Malý Slivník.
The school's management raised concerns that the municipality plans to open a daily stationary for seniors in the adjacent building currently used by the school.
This would cause not only two-shift organisation of education in the main building but also abandonment of full-day educational system within the project “School open to everybody” and operation of interest units.
3.2 Giraltovce Primary School
SSI - School Inspection Centre Prešov conducted a school inspection in Giraltovce Primary School between 27 February 2017 and 3 March 2017.
SSI imposed measures to eliminate segregation and conducted a follow-up inspection on 20 September 2017.
The follow-up inspection showed that the pupils concerned were integrated into classes with the majority.
However, it was found out that pupils of two classes (2.
A and 2.
B) were divided into two groups for religion education, while one was exclusively composed of pupils from the Roma community.
Such unjustified division showed segregation features.
A follow-up inspection of SSI on 18 October 2017 found that there were no
segregating classes or groups in the school anymore.
The school district of Giraltovce Primary School comprises of the city of Giraltovce.
Overall, 38.32 % pupils are from MRC.
Apart from pedagogic staff, the school hires speech therapist, school psychologist and special pedagogue, all of them conducting works under agreement.
90 The school requested financial resources for 5 assistant teachers and got approval for only two, plus one to whom it was entitled due to the proportion of pupils from socially disadvantaged background.
The school further stated that it established such classes to adapt education and disposable hours to pupils' needs.
Pupils from MRC have problems with Slovak, articulation, pronunciation and general readiness.
The priest himself decided to give religion classes to pupils from the majority and left the group exclusively composed of pupils from the Roma community to a catechist.
The entire Roma population attends this particular school despite the fact that there is another private primary school in the
90 Report from State School Inspection: Inspection No. 77017/2016-2017.
Separate education of pupils distantly from the school community in a different building negatively impacted social integration and showed features of segregation in a form of spatial exclusion.
A follow-up inspection of SSI on 7 December 2017 found that from the original three classes located in the Special Primary School, one zero grade class and one class with intact pupils still remain there.
The special class was relocated to a building B within the school areal where first grade classes are located.
The remaining two classes should be relocated to the B building upon termination of a loft construction (October 2018).
There are 16 classes in the school with 252 pupils in total.
92 pupils have special upbringing and educational needs, 37 of them due to health disadvantages and 55 have socially disadvantaged background.
Overall, 94 (37.30 %) pupils come from MRC.
93 Apart from pedagogic staff, the school hires one special pedagogue and speech therapist (working 2 days in a week).
One teacher assistant will start in January 2018 (although the school requested four of them).
The school would also welcome an assistant from the Roma community, however, despite its active efforts it could not find any.
There is also a primary school with Slovak as teaching language in Hurbanovo with a school district covering Hurbanovo and four nearby municipalities.
Despite the fact that Roma

Rights of persons with disabilities are governed by various documents on national as well as on international level.
Every year, the Centre informs general public about the achievements and shortcomings in the field of observance of human rights of persons with disabilities by its HR Report.
4.1 Legal Orotection of Persons with Disabilities in the Slovak Republic
4.1.1 Current legal regulation of rights of persons with disabilities
Persons with disabilities are legally protected by multiple documents on national as well as on international level, as a part of criminal law, employment law, equality law etc. In the previous HR Reports, the Centre paid attention to the protection of rights of persons with disabilities in individual chapters.
In 2017, the Centre legally represented the victims of discrimination due to the ground of disability.
In these cases, the discriminatory ground of disability was linked to certain area protected against by stipulated forms of discrimination.
commitment to respect the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and confirmed that every person is entitled to all human rights and fundamental freedoms without any distinction.
In its HR Reports95 , the Centre addressed the CPDR, which entered into the force in the Slovak Republic in 2010, on multiple occasions.
The CPDR defines disability as an always evolving term and it is the result of interaction between persons with worsen health and barriers in form of viewpoints and environment which prevent these people to fully participate with others in the society96
The Slovak Republic applied the institutional approach and in accordance with Article 33(2) of CPDR established an independent body mandated to protect rights of persons with disabilities.
- Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities.
In respect to Section 8(4) of the Act No. 176/2015 Coll. on Commissioner for Children and Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities and on Amendment of Certain Acts (hereinafter the „Act on Commissioners“), a person, who does not have a legal capacity or his/her legal capacity was restricted, has right to turn to the Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities directly or through his/her representative.
The problematic seems the fact that new legal regulation introduced by the Act No. 161/2015 Coll. Code of Civil Non-Contentious Procedure (hereinafter the “CNP Code”) does not recognise deprivation of legal capacity and the Act on Commissioner will have to deal with this issue.
4.1.3 Legal capacity in civil law
Article 12 of CPDR declares that the persons with disabilities have legal capacity in all spheres and on the same basis as others.
These guarantees should be reasonable to extent to which they impact rights of the person in question.
The provision significantly influenced the Slovak legal order as well as adopting new laws on proceedings concerning legal capacity since the proceedings concerning legal capacity are addressed by 21 Section of the CNP Code.
The exact circuit of possible parties to the proceedings ( a subject which is entitled to initiate proceedings concerning legal capacity is a close person, healthcare provider, provider of social services or a person who has an interest in the matter) is regulated by Section 233 of CNP Code.
Currently, there is still more than 16000 people in the Slovak Republic whose legal capacity was deferred and it will take approximately 8 years for courts to decide on all cases.
The opinions on the legal regulation in question varies.
Some experts are in favour of abolishment of the institute of legal capacity deprivation and often object the laxity of courts due to their promptness when deciding about the legal capacity.
The full deprivation of legal capacity was considered problematic because the extent of disability was evaluated on the basis of expert opinions respectively findings of attending physicians.
98 Previous Act No.99/1963 Coll. Civil Procedure Code, as amended regulated the proceeding in question only by seven Sections.
One of the arguments which backs the institute of legal capacity deprivation is abuse of persons with disabilities.
Persons whose legal capacity was deferred cannot acquire rights and obligations.
Currently, there is a room for third parties who could unfairly exploit such legal limitation for his/her own interests.
The deferral of the legal capacity cannot be currently accepted by the court what results in the fact that the restriction of the legal capacity should not be very restrictive to get closer to the previous legal regulation, what would de facto represent a deferral of the legal capacity.
It is questionable how should be the situation assessed by a judge who is deciding on restriction of the legal capacity.
Deferral of the legal capacity was a ultima ratio tool designed for situations where other - less repressive measures could not be used.
4.1.4 Antidiscrimination Act and the right to equal treatment
Observance of the equal treatment principle lies in the prohibition of discrimination based on the grounds of gender, religion or belief, race, nationality or ethnicity, disability,
Protection of the rights of persons with disabilities in respect to the observance of the equal treatment principle is regulated by the ADL.
After evaluation of the evidence, the court can declare that a person was discriminated against based on his/her disability in one of the above mentioned areas.
4.1.5 Criminal law aspects of protection of persons with disabilities
In the field of criminal law, the persons with disabilities as victims of crimes are granted higher protection.
The CC considers a crime against a person with disability as a generally aggravating circumstance in accordance with provisions of Section 37(a) and (c) of the CC.
The CC includes a hate motive to basic nature of several crimes.
of Some Acts (hereinafter the “CC Amendment”) introduced a new crime - apartheid and discrimination of group of persons (Section 424a of the CC).
In its statement for the Radio and Television of Slovakia, the Centre made a statement on the new amendment and pointed out genesis and historical context of apartheid.
Persons with disabilities are considered a group of persons which systematic discrimination can constitute a crime.
As a member of the network of equality bodies (Equinet), the Centre requested good practice examples of the protection of persons with disabilities in the context of analysis and comparison of specific motivation in other EU members with Section 140 of the CC.
We point out that in the Slovak criminal law, there is no category of hate crimes.
The abovementioned specific intent can refer to the hatred.
As an interesting example, we can mention Scotland where a sole hate speech aimed at persons with disabilities at football matches is considered a crime (so called.
We would like to state that the results of the analysis of received materials show that individual criminal codes recognise motive of hatred against persons with disabilities in definitions of individual crimes.
Despite the amendment of the CC by specific motive in letter (e) by the CC Amendment in 2016 - “due to the hatred towards group of persons or individuals due to their actual or putative origin, colour of skin, gender, sexual
103 Crime of apartheid is defined in Section 140a of the CC as a crime of extremism.
104 Article 131(1) of the Slovenian Criminal Code (KZ-1) as amended.
The Section 139(f) of the CC defines a term - sick person.
As an illness is considered any variation of regular life processes of a person and we can subsume under the illness also a physical and psychological disorder.
Severe bodily harm is defined by Section 123(3)(a) to (i) as a serious health disorder or serious illness (mutilation, paralysis of a limb) respectively as a health disorder which lasts a longer period of time - defined by the CC as 42 calendar days.
Looking at the relevant individual provisions of the CC reflect three basic forms of protection of the rights of persons with disabilities:
105 As a person with severe disability is considered a person whose extent of functional disability is at least 50%.
In the 2016 HR Report, the Centre recommended to the Ministry of Health in cooperation with the Chamber to draft the exact definition of term - psycho-social disorder in pursuant to examples from twelve countries which already defined this term in accordance with the current medical findings.
The Chamber has shown the willingness to open the discussion on its conclusion on the topic as well as to discuss the incorrect interpretation of term discrimination on 8 August 2017.
ICD is in its current version 10 recognises two groups of illnesses: somatic and psychological.
Every psychologic or somatic illnesses listed in the ICD caused by social factors (bullying, mobbing, bossing, other psychological or physical violence mentioned in the Centre's Report) can be found in the ICD.
Therefore, we do not propose to introduce another term “psycho-social disorder ”.
In the respective case, it is a psychological or combined psychological and somatic disorder caused by social factors.
Illnesses caused by social factors such as emotion disorders, behavioural changes concerning social contacts mentioned in the Centre's report, phobias etc. are already recognised by the ICD and were given codes F30 F69.
For this purpose, it would be beneficial, in accordance with example of Section 3(1) of the Act 576/2004 Coll. on Healthcare and on Services related to the Provision of Healthcare, as amended, to include to this act also a provision on usage of the ICD.
The Centre has accepted the recommendations of the Chamber and amended the recommendations for the Ministry of Health.
How has the situation developed?
Was any progress expected by the society and mainly by persons with disabilities achieved?
DD PF DK is located in a three-floor building.
The main entrance to the building has stairs and there are more stairs between each floor.
109 Statements of the Ministry of Interior, the Support Centre Žilina and the District Directorate of the Police Corps in Dolný Kubín to the Centre's request in 2017.
contact employees of DD PC DK by phone to request assistance to move within the building.
F or the purposes of 2017 HR report, DD PC DK stated that its employees keep providing persons with disabilities with alternative solutions allowing them to apply for identification documents at their residence.
This service is provided to immobile citizens upon their request or upon request of their relatives.
A year after, the Centre was interested in the stage of elimination of barriers in the building.
This was done by removal of original kerbs and their replacement by new ones securing smooth passage from the rode to the pavement, including for persons in wheelchairs.
DD PC DK further informed that the electronic ring and telecommunication terminal were re-installed and placed in a lower height and hence accessible for persons in wheelchairs.
New plastic casement doors replaced entrance doors to DD PC DK.
Moreover, a lift was installed in the building allowing transport from the ground floor
111 Statement of the District Directorate of the Police Force in Dolný Kubín regarding the Centre's request of 16 January 2018: “In 2017, the alternative measure allowing immobile citizens to apply for identification documents at their residence was provided in 30 cases, in Tvrdošín district 5 times, in Dolný Kubín district 18 times and in Námestovo district 7 times”.
limited mobility and orientation as well as an outside ramp allowing access to the premises.
Both the platform and the ramp would only be used upon valid expert decision.
DD PC DK building is one of many buildings which should be unconditionally made accessible for persons with limited mobility.
In its 2016 HR Report, the Centre referred to information provided by the Ministry of Interior concerning the number of buildings, which were fully or partially accessible.
The Ministry of Interior stated that 74 buildings of Police Corps were made fully accessible and 52 Police Corps buildings were made partially accessible.
188 Police Corps buildings still require full or partial elimination of barriers, e.g. DD PC DK building.
The Centre believes that Ministry of Interior would proactively continue with the established trend of elimination of barriers in its buildings.
112 Statement of the city of Žilina regarding the Centre's request of 14 February 2018.
The process of elimination of barriers in this building is highly influenced by the fact that the building belongs to national cultural heritage113, while SP Košice 1 rents the premises from Slovak Telekom, a. s. (hereinafter the “ST”).
As an alternative solution, SP introduced the so-called special regime of service available publicly to costumers of SP Košice 1 during office hours.
In practice, the “special regime” meant that an information plate was placed on the building of SP Košice 1, right next to the stairs, informing costumers facing difficulties to enter the building due to the lack of accessible entrance about a phone contact to an employee of SP Košice 1.
Upon contacting, this employee served costumers outside the building.
solution needed to be adopted among SP, ST (the owner of the building), the Regional Monuments Board Košice (hereinafter the “RMB Košice”) and the Magistrate of the City of Košice.
Was any compromise reached in the previous year?
The result of negotiations in this case can serve as good practice example for other similar cases.
115 Statement of the Office of the Main Architect of the City of Košice regarding the Centre's request of 2 February 2018.
116 Statement of the Slovak Telecom, a.s. regarding the Centre's request of 17 January 2018.
4.4 Emergency Number 112 Now Also for Persons with Disabilities
What if it is a person with disability who needs to call the emergency line?
The amendment was approved in December 2017 by the National Council of the Slovak Republic and entered into force on 1 January 2018.117
The amendment also fulfilled one of the aims of the National Programme for Development of Living Conditions of Persons with Disabilities for the Years 2014 - 2020118, in particular to secure access to the emergency line 112 for persons with hearing disabilities.
In line with the new regulation, persons with disabilities can access the emergency line 112, which
serves in situations when life, health, property, public order are in danger or when assistance of Police Corps, firefighters or rescue services is needed.
The Centre welcomes the progress achieved within one year.

Citizens shall have the right to free education at primary and secondary schools and depending on the abilities of the individual and the potential of the society also at universities.
The Slovak Constitution further states that law shall establish eligibility for financial assistance for students from public funds.

visual disability, physical disability, impaired communication ability as well as a child/pupil with autism or other pervasive development disorders of multiple disability.
The aim of education and upbringing of pupils with disabilities, apart from general aims of education, is to teach them to develop their own compensation mechanisms as much as possible, to fully perceive and live their life and to undertake determined activities to create values.
It is also organised in other types of schools in special classes opened usually for children/pupils with the same health disability, while education and upbringing partially takes place in classes with other children/pupils or the child/pupil attends certain subjects or activities outside the special class.
Education and upbringing of these children/pupils can also be organised in general schools, particularly in classes or groups with other children/pupils and, if necessary, a child/pupil follows an individual education programme.
The school prepares this programme in cooperation with school facility of upbringing prevention and consultancy and a legal representative of the child/pupil is entitled to be informed about it.
Pursuant to the School Act, upbringing and education of children/pupils with disabilities is organised in nursery schools, primary schools, secondary schools, vocational schools and practical schools.
vzdelavanie-ziakov-so-svvp/vychova/
The Centre pays attention to integration of children/pupils with disabilities in general nursery schools, primary and secondary schools.
Pursuant to data provided by the Ministry of Education122, from 160 309 children in nursery schools there were 555 children with disabilities.
The Ministry of Education stated that in the past year, there were 1 356 children in special nursery school and 165 children in classes at nursery schools.
Special primary schools were attended by 17 574 pupils, while 9 357 children attended special classes at primary schools.
Special secondary schools were attended by 5 858 students and there were only 68 students in special classes at secondary schools.
Accordingly, from the overall number of 807 461 children and students at nursery schools, primary and secondary schools, the number of children and students with disabilities educated in these schools is 38 854.
a) insufficient capacities in nursery schools also for children with no disabilities,
d) material resources such as special education tools, compensation tools or resources to
adapt the environment, lack of readiness of pedagogic employees and pupils/children with no disabilities for integration and acceptance of children/pupils with disabilities in their group, school or class,
e) insufficient awareness of pedagogic employees, pupils/students with no disabilities and their parents about specific health disabilities of integrated pupils/students,
f) insufficient awareness of parents of children/pupils with disabilities about options for education and upbringing of their children.
Within inclusive education, it is crucial to provide these children/pupils and their parents a certain form of assistance or support in order to adapt to circumstances of a “standard” environment.
We should not let the barriers, fear from inclusion or beliefs that inclusive education of children with disabilities can negatively affect education of children with no disabilities win.
02. The Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic in cooperation with the Slovak Medical Chamber amend the definition of properly provided medical care pursuant to Section 4 (3) and following provisions of the Act No. 576/2004 Coll. on Healthcare and on Services Related to the Provision of Healthcare, as amended by the proper determination

07. The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic and the Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic provide material resources for nursery schools, primary schools and secondary schools necessary for inclusive education of children with disabilities.
08. The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic ensure preparation and sufficient awareness of pedagogic employees of nursery schools, primary or secondary schools concerning accessibility and specific needs of children with disabilities and with regard to specific disabilities.
09. The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic increase awareness of parents of children with disabilities concerning opportunities for inclusive education of their children.
The underlying reason for adopting TCM shall be the ambition to secure equal opportunities in practice.
TCM shall target a particular group affected by structural discrimination.
The target group, i.e. recipients of TCM, must be individualised by a specific feature - the ground of discrimination.
Under the Slovak legislation, TCM can target various groups.
One of them is the Roma minority in terms of TCM addressing socioeconomic disadvantages and aimed at elimination of discrimination and prejudices against this group.
Another target group could be the Hungarian minority or the Ruthenian minority.
The Centre annually covers the issue of TCM in its HR Reports126 and focuses mainly on TCM projects or projects with certain features of TCM as measures capable to effectively eliminate or prevent disadvantages.
The Centre analysed particular features of TCM in general and their legislative regulation in its former HR reports (mainly 2014 HR Report)127.
For the purposes of this report, the Centre approached the selected public bodies and other relevant subjects with questions regarding adoption, implementation and cooperation on TCM in 2017.
The Centre aims to provide a comprehensive overview of implemented projects, taking into account that TCM can only be effective if systematically implemented.
Similarly as in the previous years, the Centre did not receive any report on the adopted TCM in 2017 upon initiative of a subject entitle to adopt TCM.
128 These subjects (mainly public bodies) inf adopted projects, which they consider TCM, only in response to the Centre's requests.
127 See:
examples on benefits of TCM, as well as promotion of tolerance in the society and towards authorities are crucial.
Social and economic disadvantages limit opportunities for equal participation at life.
Usually, if an individual faces socioeconomic disadvantages, these disadvantages affect more than one area and last for longer time, sometimes even the whole life.
5.1 Activities of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic Conducted in 2017
The Ministry of Agriculture, as a managing authority for the Integrated Regional Operational Programme 2014 - 2020, secured implementation of various calls relevant for the horizontal priority “Supporting equality of men and women and non-discrimination” in 2017.
These calls also followed-up on measures aimed at balancing opportunities for disadvantaged groups.
The envisaged period of implementation is the programme period 2014 - 2020 (implementation of projects).
Elimination or mitigation of identified disadvantages is realized in the form of non-repayable financial contributions for realisation of the projects.
Target groups included disadvantaged groups, mainly members of MRC.
The organisation Healthy Regions kept creating space for realisation of complex and sustainable measures to address the situation of disadvantaged groups at the national level in the area of health.
One of the key activities in this area is the continuous project Healthy Communities financed under the European structural and investment funds covered by the Centre in its previous HR Reports.
TCM aimed at elimination of social disadvantages focus on enhancing equal access to health care, basic health services and information.
Exact clinical studies show a significant higher load of infection and non-infection diseases.
Long-term effect of health-endangering factors for a certain ethical group is always linked to historical consequences of social processes.
These social processes include discrimination, racism and spatial segregation (sometimes by entire non-Roma generations), various forms of disinterest, dislike, self-underestimation and even voluntary segregation.
People from Roma settlements consequently achieve lower education, show higher rates of long-term unemployment and have the lowest incomes.
Up to 31 January 2018, the total number of employees was 222, including 19 persons working in the headquarters, 21 health awareness assistants' coordinators and 182 health awareness assistants.
The main activity of the National Project Healthy Communities remains realisation and development of health mediation in MRC.
Its aims mainly include: decreased barriers in access to health care, increased health literacy and improved health-related behaviour (especially decreasing life-style related risks).131
5.3 Activities of the Ministry of Transport and Construction of the Slovak Republic Conducted in 2017
The Ministry of Transport provided grants for development of housing under the Act No. 443/2010 Coll. on Grants for Housing Development and on Social Housing, as amended.
Eligible applicants for grant include municipalities, cities, self-governing regions and nonprofit organisations established by them to provide generally beneficial services in the area of housing.
Compared to the previous years, the limit of entitled costs for grants has changed since 1 January 2017, particularly concerning constructions fulfilling the strictest requirements for heat technology features of constructions.
In combination of these two funding sources (grants and preferential loans), acquisition of approximately 2 000 rental flats and full or partial reconstruction of blocks of flats with approximately 28 700 flats were supported in 2017.
The Ministry of Transport does not keep statistics on social background of final users of the contributions provided.
In 2017, the Ministry of Transport also adopted a measure to eliminate disadvantages based on nationality.
Throughout the year, Železnice Slovenskej republiky (Railways of the Slovak Republic) placed signs with the name of a station (station building, not a railway stop) in Slovak and in the language of a national minority in those municipalities where a national minority represents at least 20 % of the population.
A precondition was that the station concerned operated regular public personal transport.
In the area of railway transport, increased accessibility of information on railway transport for persons with disabilities is required.
These projects and measures have some of the features of TCM.
To support culture of disadvantaged groups, EUR 980 000 were allocated under the grant programme in 2017.
Activities supported under the grant programme include cultural activities for persons with disabilities or other disadvantaged groups, including cultural activity of these persons and groups supporting equal opportunities and integration in the society, prevention and elimination of all forms of violence, discrimination, racism, xenophobia and extremism, education towards tolerance, enhanced social and family cohesion and development of intercultural dialogue.
The grant programme aims at:
a) supporting culture,
b) supporting periodic press contributing to equal opportunities in the area of cultural activity and providing information on life and culture of persons with disabilities or other disadvantaged groups, publishing non-periodic press in the area of original,
classic, expert and translation literature,
5.5 Activities of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic Conducted in 2017

6 Discrimination of the Elderly
6.1 Providing Financial Services in the Banking
In respect to the observance of the equal treatment principle and the issue of discrimination of the elderly, the Centre has addressed the issue of linking the provision of financial services in banking sector to the age of applicant.
The current situation on the market of loan products can be evaluated as relatively inhomogeneous.
In its 2015 HR Report, the Centre concluded that the approach of individual commercial banks when setting the client's age requirements - an applicant for a loan was diverse despite the set regulatory requirements of the prudent business.
On the basis of its own findings and to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, in its 2015 HR Report, the Centre recommended to the banks, while observing the rules of prudent business, to consider providing optional bank products and raising the age limit for the final loan maturity to the statistical average life expectancy in the Slovak Republic, to reconsider the criteria for loan drawdown and proceed to providing specialised loan products for applicants of age 62 (respectively 65) so the discriminatory treatment of this group of society is minimized.
At the same time, to secure the transparency of criteria of the lending policies, the Centre recommended to the banks to introduce products for the target group of age 62 and older separately.
To the National Bank of Slovakia (hereinafter the “NBS”), when conducting the supervisory mandate in the field of financial consumer protection, the Centre recommended to focus especially on the different treatment in the field of providing loan products based on other than objective and reasonable facts.
In 2016 and 2017, the Centre monitored the banking products provided by the commercial banks or by the branches of foreign banks on the Slovak financial market.
136 ibid
The bank does not provide any specialised loan products to clients above the retirement age.
Slovenská záručná a rozvojová banka, a.s.
The exception are specialised products for young and starting entrepreneurs where the upper age limit is set.
The bank does not have any loan products for non-business clients.
It specialises on private banking.

of the applicant is not determining and such loans are also provided to the clients of the retirement age.
The loan products designed to general population hate the age limit set to the limit of 65 years of age of the debtor - the age by which the loan must be repaid.
The bank justified the upper age limit by the laws which requires the banks, when reviewing the income of the consumer, to take into consideration expected decrease of the income due to starting receiving pension.
OTP Banka Slovensko, a.s., does not provide specialised loan products for clients exceeding the retirement age.
As a reason for this restriction, it states the regulation of the supervisory public authorities (e.g. recommendations of the NBS) which set the rules for conducting prudent business and consumer protection.
One of the basic tools of the consumer protection is an evaluation of the ability to repay the loan during the whole duration of repayment timeframe, including the possibility of the income decline after the retirement.
Information on the age limits are confidential and the bank considers it being a subject of its trade secret.
Tatra banka, a.s.,/Tatra Banka, a.s., branch Raiffeisen do not provide specialised loan products to the clients exceeding the retirement age.
When the application for a loan is submitted, the bank considers a complex scale of information about the applicant.
It requires the client to meet also certain age requirements.
The minimum acceptable age is 18 years of age and the maximum age depends on the individual loan product.
The bank stipulates that it tries to be open to loan applicants, and therefore it has also loan products accessible for elderly.
To the applicants of higher age, it provides a possibility to apply for a loan together with younger person - a co-applicant (co-debtor).
The aim of the age limit is to protect client and the bank and to avoid problems caused by the inability of the client to

• Allowed overdraft: 18 to 65 years of age including.
If it comes to credit card loans and allowed overdrafts, the applicant cannot be older than 65 years of age at the time of submission of the application.
The limits are set in accordance with the Act on Home Loans, Act on Consumer Loans and recommendations of the NBS.
In respect to the legislation and internal policy of risk management, the bank provides loans with certain age limits.
When determining the age limits, the bank applies: Measure of the NBS č.
10/2016 dated 13 December 2016, which stipulates the details on assessment of the ability of a consumer to repay a home loan (67 years of age at the loan maturity).
Všeobecná úverová banka, a.s. does not provide specialised loan products designed for people exceeding the retirement age.
However, provision of a loan product at the higher age is not excluded.
146 From the answer of Slovenská sporiteľna, a.s. to the questions of the Centre dated 16 February 2018.
147 Section 27c of the Act No. 483/2001 Coll. on Banks, as amended.
According to the statement of the NBS's Department for the Supervision of the Financial Consumers Protection, there were no complaints registered in regard to the violation of the equal treatment principle in provision financial services by the subjects supervised by the NBS in 2017.
The majority of banks does not provide loans and mortgages for applicants older than 65 years of age.
Some banks allow exceptions which depends on the ability of a particular applicant to repay a loan after reaching the retirement age what is assessed by loan experts of the respective bank.
The limitation of the repayment period of loan has an impact on the maximum amount of the loan.
To acquire the most accurate data on the observance of the equal treatment principle in the field of provision of banking services, the Centre also requested information from the Slovak Bank Association (hereinafter the “SBA”).
In 2017, the SBA dealt with multiple complaints whose subject matter was violation of the equal treatment principle (based on disability, ethnic origin or other status) where the applicants objected the bank's approach.
Moreover, the Centre did not have information about the abovementioned complaints and the SBA did not refer these cases to the Centre.
It concludes that even though, the pension is a steady income, age and health of the client are risk factors when banks decide on providing a loan.
Older workers remain more often on the labour market what would be beneficial to consider when assessing the income of older applicants.
However, the upper age limit of the applicant without taking other individual specifics into account should not be the sole reason for the rejection.
In the past, the provision of loans to clients of higher age and repayment of home loans by clients older than 65 years was problematic.
offer to the clients exceeding the retirement age and its comparison with the 2017 answers provided by the requested subjects, the Centre evaluated the current situation on the market as more favourable to elderly.
The Centre concludes that the approach of individual commercial banks to setting the age limit for applicants varies.
The general statements of some banks about complying with laws in the field of banking and consumer protection can be considered as a simplification of potential discrimination of loan applicants.
On the banking market, there are still institutions which take into account that due to the aging population, the working life of population is being prolonged.
The pensioners who work have a part of their income taken away without a relevant connection to pension, for payoff of which all legal requirements were met.
If the aggregate of the pensions above is less than the tax allowance referred to in subsection 2 above, the tax base shall be reduced as provided in subsection 2 above only by the difference between the tax allowance referred to in subsection 2 above and the aggregate of the pensions paid out to the taxpayer.”
The abovementioned measure puts persons who, in accordance to the Act No. 586/1992 Coll. on Income Tax, as amended, are having another income apart from receiving the pension to disadvantageous position in comparison to other tax payers who are not receiving a pension.
The higher income tax, from which the non-taxable minimum is not deducted represents legal and moral issue which, in connection to legal duty to observe the equal treatment principle and the prohibition of discrimination, is closely linked to the group of working pensioners in the Slovak Republic.
- If the sum of this pension is in total higher than the non-taxable portion of the tax base per taxpayer.
If the amount of the pension does not exceed the sum of non-taxable portion of the tax base per taxpayer, that is EUR 3830.02, the tax base is cut by the sum given by the calculation EUR 3830.02 - the pension paid.

The average Slovak pension appears to be acceptable in
However, this indicator is considerable skewed.
The Slovak pensioner must adapt to significantly modest living after the retirement in contrast with Austrian or Swiss pensioners.
After the retirement, the pensioners in the Slovak Republic are reaching the poverty line.
At the retirement age, a person has three options: (i) to live from the received pension, (ii) to postpone the retirement and continue with economic activity or (iii) or to receive the pension and, at the same time continue to be economically active.

The majority of elderly work during the retirement to preserve their existing standard of living that would not be possible to keep while only receiving the pension.
The provisions of the Income Tax Act which raise the tax burden of the working pensioners are discriminatory.
Discriminatory provisions are not only in conflict with applicable laws but they also represent a moral dilemma when legislator disadvantages the work of certain target group.
The tax disadvantage and sanctioning a person who is working because the person receives also the pension is clearly demotivating.
Due to the higher extent of the taxation, pensioners often give up and stop working.
Therefore, the state puts pensioners to a different position in comparison to other working population while there is no rational or objective reason to do so.
It is not possible to ignore the fact that due to the aging population in the context of demographic changes, the longer working life becomes a must.
The significance of the increasing participation of elderly on the labour market and their employability as well as productivity is rising.
The multiple EU member states have taken steps to support the integration of older workers on the labour market.
It is important to change the stereotypical view on ageing which perceives elderly as a homogenous group of people without individualising differences and as a burden to the society because it receives the substantial proportion of public finances.
It is not possible to look non-critically on the fact that working pensioners must prove their qualities and fight for their social status.
category employee is not fixed only by the approach of the society or manifestations of ageism but also by a legal provisions of an EU member state.
The harmony between the almost identical laws and the anti-discrimination legislation was already solved in the Czech Republic where the measure, due to which the working pensioners were not entitled to apply for the non-taxable proportion of tax base raised a significant resentment.

This type of cancer represents 18% of all cancer illnesses in the population in the Slovak Republic.
The trend of mortality increases by 20 - 30% was recorded in the countries providing screening.
“154 Early the cancer is discovered, the better are prospects to cure.
The most effective ways of discovering the breast cancer, and therefore decreasing its risks is conducting a mammography screening on a regular basis.
It is usually the first contact gynaecologist who recommends a patient to this voluntary examination.
The fully covered regular mammography screening of the breast cancer in the Slovak Republic is restricted to women no older than 69 years of age.
In particular, the discrimination on the grounds of age in the field of health care provision can be discussed.
The age specific diagram of the occurrence of breast carcinoma has its characteristics.
The illness concerns young and pre-menopausal women only rarely.
In the Slovak Republic, the age specific incidence has sharply climbing character as of the third decade of women's life.
The mammography is able to diagnose 75% of malignant breast carcinoma in the 5th decade and 90% of malignant carcinoma in women in 6th and 7th decade of their lives.
The process of population aging is non-reversible and will accelerate in coming decades.
According to the research of World Health Organisation and Imperial College London, it is
156 Bella, V., Kállayová, A.: “National Screening Programme of the Breast Cancer in the Slovak Republic" available online in Slovak at www.ruzovastuzka.sk/main2018/images/dokumenty/skrining.pdf
The statistics show that in last years, the average life expectancy has also been climbing in the Slovak Republic and, in the case of women, it has currently reached 79 years of age.
Although the prognosis has been improving significantly, the hope for healthy endowment, on which participates also the healthcare, still lags.
Considering the development and prognosis indicators, it can be expected that the number of illnesses and deaths to non-infectious aetiology diseases will climb.
Given the abovementioned facts, the age settings lack the objective, rational and, most importantly legitimate reasoning.
The analysis of certain studies shows the advantages and effectiveness of mammography screening in 80 years old and older women.
The analysis of the development of breast cancer provides important information for the optimal screening settings because based on the proportion of its occurrence in individual age groups, it is necessary to set the age of women who need screening.
A pilot study focused on the evaluation of effectiveness of screening programme during which women older than 70 years were invited for the examination, revealed a high occurrence of the illness.
Therefore, all women older than 45 years have access to the screening without restrictions.
According to the data of the CONCORD
160 Jan Činčura: “Screening of the Breast Carcinoma for 75 Years Old Women?”
161 Breast Cancer Screening Programs in 26 ICSN Countries (2012) Organization, Policies, and Program Reach Data are from a survey of ICSN country representatives conducted in 2012.

programme, the life expectancy after diagnosis of the breast cancer in the Slovak Republic did not substantially improve in the last decade and, in comparison with many other EU member states it has deepened.

To the certain extent, relatively low survival rate of breast cancer is linked to its late detection.
As stated by the Strategic Framework for Health for the Years 2013 - 2030:
163 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development: “Slovakia: Country Health Profile” (2017).
164 National Centre for Healthcare Information
„ Currently, in comparison with other EU member states, the Slovak Republic is achieving low level of the healthcare efficiency.
Conducting preventive programmes is one of the measures to increase the quality of healthy life in the Slovak Republic.
In respect to the patients' rights, the Centre points out to the fact that “the right to protection of health and healthcare in the Slovak Republic is ensured...in accordance with the equal treatment principle.
The low survival rate of the breast cancer is, to certain extent, linked to its late detection.

167 Political Declaration and Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing.
Therefore, the Centre recommends paying attention to necessity to allow women of 69 years of age and older to access the organised, quality and free-of-charge mammography screening of breast cancer in the Slovak Republic to improve the early diagnostics and detect the breast cancer in the earliest stage possible.
Recommendations:
01. Banks re-evaluate the current criteria for providing consumer loans for clients older than 65 years of age and, while observing the quantitative rules of prudent business, start to provide specialised loan products so that the risk of discrimination treatment with this group of society would be minimised.
Data collection in this area can focus on those information concerning particular manifestations of extremism in the society but also those on prevention mechanisms.
The second group of information is equally important since it covers information aimed at prevention of increased radicalisation of the society causing racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic or other extremist incidents.
The following subchapters analyse current prevention mechanisms for fighting extremism, evaluate their implementation and the level of involvement by relevant stakeholders in this area.
The Centre thereby underlines the irreplaceable role of proper implementation of prevention mechanisms for fighting extremism in the society.
With increased extremisms in the society, the interest level concerning activities of lawenforcement bodies, primarily responsible for investigating crimes of extremism168, also increases.
A lot has been published on repressive aspect of fighting extremism, including news articles, expert studies as well as regular media news concerning fight against extremism through repression measures.
168 See Section 140a of Criminal Code.
7.1 Prevention and Its Role
criminality and secure public order.
170 Radical or extremist expressions can attain to a crime and are often results of improper upbringing of an individual in his or her home or school environment.
In these regards, the Centre appeals to the need for adoption of systematic measures aimed at increasing effectiveness of upbringing and educational processes at primary and secondary schools.
It is in schools where attitudes and opinions of a young person are being formed from early age.
Apart from quality education, schools should also provide such conditions for complex development of the youth that would be in line with the principles of a democratic state.
Prevention from increased extremism in any form includes many stakeholders who contribute with their particular tasks to a sustainable situation, stagnation and even decreasing occurrences of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism or other extremist expressions.
Social prevention creates such conditions preventing a person to become a penetrator of a crime or to continue with
170 Daniška, G., Strémy, T., Vráblová, M. at all.
(3rd Ed. 2016, Aleš Čenek) p. 147.
Repression undoubtedly has a potential of prevention in case it sends a clear message to the society on limits of the freedom of speech in line with the related jurisprudence.
In terms of this, current results and situation in relation to practice of judicial authorities in Slovakia are unfortunately not convincing.
Quoting Jeremy Bentham, criminality, including extremist criminality, can be prevented by establishing such environment when a power of sentence overrides the pleasure of committing crimes.
172 Daniška, G., Strémy, T., Vráblová, M. at all.
(3rd Ed. 2016, Aleš Čenek) p. 149 - 150.
173 There are several definitions of criminology.

; or Kaiser, G.: “Kriminológie.
174 Daniška, G., Strémy, T., Vráblová, M. at all.
Therefore, responsibility for increasing extremist expressions in the society is also born by media.
Headings in Slovak media do not address information on preventive mechanisms to fight racism, xenophobia or anti-Semitism.
Significant attention is given to the work of the Criminality Prevention Unit.
In a wider context it must be stated that more than EUR 1.5 million has been awarded to main research tasks and analyses.
The Centre calls for the responsible actors to pay due diligence
The Centre welcomes the activity of the Ministry of Education that published a state educational programme defining compulsory content of upbringing and education for gaining skills at schools.
In terms of this, pupils should not only be passive actors of education consuming final knowledge to be learnt and reproduced.
Civic education contribute to creation and development of social and civic awareness of pupils.
It provides them with necessary knowledge and skills, which would enable them to orientate in the social environment and standard life situations.
It helps pupils to better understand themselves and assists them in the process of socialisation.
It helps them to understand better their family, school, municipality, region, Slovakia and EU.
Civic education teaches pupils to think and act democratically, to know their rights and duties as well as to defend rights of others.
Pupils gain basic knowledge in the area of law, state and economic life of the society and they are encouraged to active civil participation and critical thinking.
By a thorough analysis of activities of responsible institutions in the area of criminality prevention, including prevention from extremism, the Centre concluded that their work is not conceptual and systematic when it comes to adopting measures to improve upbringing and educational processes at primary and secondary schools.
The adopted measures lack sufficient attention of media, causing doubts of the public whether such measures should be even adopted and implemented.
When adopting measures to prevent extremism among the youth, attention is usually paid to training of pedagogic employees in the area of human rights and freedoms.
One of the indicators could be more frequent media reports on
increasing extremism in Slovakia.
One of the underlying causes is underestimation of preventive mechanisms in upbringing processes at Slovak primary and secondary schools.
Since November 2017, the Methodical and Pedagogical Centre in Prešov provides a training program “Development of skills of a pedagogic employee in the area of prevention from extremism”.180 This program seems to follow up on activities conducted by the Ministry of Education already before 2017.181 Its aim is to support and develop professional competences of pedagogic employees in order to properly implement prevention mechanisms into educational processes to decrease level of extremist expressions.
Since the project is only in its initial stage, the Centre cannot objectively assess its results.
The Centre, however, underlines the need for adoption of systematic steps improving educational process at schools with active and effective cooperation among the Criminality Prevention Unit, the Ministry of Education, municipalities and self-governing regions.
7.3 Research of the Slovak National Centre for Human Rights
In 2017, the Centre conducted a research “Racism and Xenophobia among Young People in Slovakia”182 aimed at gathering information concerning racial and xenophobic opinions of young people.
The research gathered data at 21 schools across Slovakia (1 323 pupils and students in between 11 - 19 years of age) and brought about interesting facts on attitudes of the youth towards individual national, ethnic, cultural or religious groups.
Hate, racist and xenophobic manifestations are more frequent in Europe and in Slovakia while preferences of extremist political parties grow.
181 This would include a Methodical guidance for employees of counselling facilities within the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic, which focuses on prevention of extremism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance in schools.
Similarly, Research Institute of Child Psychology and Psychopathology in Bratislava issued a publication “Educating controversial topics - Professional development package for effective education of questionable issues”.
182 Available online at: http://www.snslp.sk/CCMS/files/Vvskum SNSLP ras xen 2017-FINAL.pdf
Despite this, more than 80 % respondents are aware of the fact that there are negative prejudices against various groups of people around them.
In terms of religious groups, 40.29 % respondents admitted that they negatively perceived Muslims.
This attitude is not surprising, since opinions of people are highly influenced by media, which often biasedly blame Muslims for terroristic attacks in Europe.
Such generalisation incites to attitudes of hatred towards all members of a particular group.
More than 10 % respondents also have negative attitudes towards Jews, however 55 % of neutral answers is higher than concerning other religious groups.
More than 34 % respondents has positive attitudes towards Jews.
The biggest proportion of young people, 70 %, in total, positively perceived Christians.
Regarding racial and ethnical groups, surprisingly, positive perception of black people (55 %) prevails overs positive perception of Asian people (44,9 %).
Only 14 % respondents have positive attitudes towards Roma and in general, this group was considered the most problematic in the society.
More than 33 % respondents stated that they did not feel safe in the presence of people of different cultures, religion or nationality.
The research brought about many valuable findings responding to current debates.
It represents a comprehensive overview of issues related to racism and xenophobia among the Slovak youth, which yet has not been sufficiently researched.
The results can be used as an insight into how young people perceive our society and aim to contribute to ongoing debate on manifestations and dangers of extremism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism as well as ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious diversity in our society.
The research can also serve the Ministry of Education or the Criminality Prevention Unit as well as local self-governments for enhancement and further development of preventive mechanisms at schools.
7.4 Importance of Preventive Mechanisms Online
Neglecting proper implementation of prevention mechanisms is one of the underlying causes of widespread extremists and intolerant expressions in the society.
Internet remains a space for expansion of hate speech.
In 2017, the Centre recorded a huge amount of cases presented in media when a content of hate speech breached moral values and rules of the society however as such it did not entail to a misdemeanour or a crime of extremism.
The Centre particularly highlights justified protection of the freedom of speech, which is necessary for development of any democratic society.
However, incorrect interpretation of its limits remains problematic.
The extremist groups often claim that their members are victims of censure.
Guidance on where is the line between the freedom of speech and hate speech can be found in the established jurisprudence of international judicial authorities.
Distinguishing what is acceptable and setting up indicators to define certain expressions as unprotected by the freedom of speech is often an unsolvable riddle for providers of social networks and online discussion fora themselves.
Social networks and other platforms contribute to uncontrollable spread of information of various content, even such that can cause poised debate, create or deepen prejudice against different groups of society including those groups that do not represent minorities in Slovakia.
Adoption and implementation of concrete prevention mechanisms is hence important to decrease the number of hate speech online in the future.
Social networks and discussion fora providers should use prevention measures to send a message to members of extremist groups that “their” online space is not a space to manipulate opinion of the youth in order to spread hatred neither a place to commit crimes.
The Centre appreciates efforts of internet technology companies to fight increasing hate speech online and establishing cooperation among providers of the biggest social networks.
Outcomes of this cooperation include adoption of the so-called code of conducts reacting to current situation.
The Centre is aware of the fact that extremist groups use online space to spread hatred and recruit new members.
Therefore, more prompt the reaction of responsible administrators at social networks and discussion fora to prevent spread of such hatred is, the lower numbers of people join the existing extremist groups.
The Centre takes into account the fact that hate speech penetrators are becoming more sophisticated and seek to use various indirect means and hidden ciphers to identify with extremist groups.
Hence, prevention mechanisms must be formed even more consistently and responsibly.
Another promising practice to fight extremism online from 2017 is a call of the President of the Slovak Republic for submission of projects on data collection and fight against increasing hate on the Internet.
183 The aim of the winning project “#somtu” (“#Iamhere”) organised by a group of young people is to bring decency, empathy and facts into online discussions.
Already in its 2016 HR Report, the Centre recommended that media inform the public sensitively and objectively about the migration crises to prevent increasing hate speech and radicalisation in the society.
02. Social media administrators and website providers in cooperation with the Criminality
183 More information about the winning project is available at: http://somtu.sk/
Prevention Unit at the Office of the Minister of Interior of the Slovak Republic adopt codes of conduct online clearly stating that their websites do not tolerate promotion of hatred in any form.
The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic pay due attention to upbringing of growing youth at schools and warn against dangers and risks related to spreading of hatred towards certain groups of people through education at primary and secondary schools and through respective curricula.
The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic pay due attention to development of educational skills of pedagogic employees by implementing particular measures and publishing their impacts.
Key issues in this area remain mechanisms for refugees' relocation, reception of refugees and implementation of other means to support and assist the most affected countries.
In terms of human rights, long-term problems persisted also in 2017, in particular incidents of human smuggling, insufficient, poor legal aid for asylum seekers, procedural mistakes in asylum procedures, discrepancies in interpretation of relevant legislation, observance of the rights of minor migrants and their detention.
As such it can be noted that there are now sufficient housing capacities for refugees.
8.1 Observance of the Right to International Protection in the Slovak Republic
Slovakia is one of the countries with low numbers of migrants and refugees seeking international protection184 and it is considered mainly as a transit country.
Irrespective of personal motivation of migrants and refugees, who do not see Slovakia as a final destination, this situation is a result of various objective factors precluding attempts to irregularly cross the borders185 and departing migration routes away from the Slovak territory.
184 Section 2 of the Act on Asylum.
In terms of the European migration crisis escalating in 2015, we can identify influx of refugees, asylum applications or granted asylums related to the EU relocation and resettlement programmes aimed at mitigating impacts of the crisis in the mostly affected countries and manifestations of the so-called flexible solidarity.
Certain differences can be seen when comparing numbers of international protection granted, although Slovakia belong to countries that often directly grant asylum instead.
189 In terms of subsidiary protection, Slovakia is one of three countries with the lowest number of approved applications.
Nationalities of the applicants in Slovakia mirrored the most common groups of applicants for international protection with the whole EU.
Available statistics of the Migration Office of the Slovak Republic190 reveal that in the period between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017, 166 asylum proceedings started, while 153 cases concerned first-time applicants.
In 2017, asylum was granted in 29 cases and subsidiary protection in 25 cases.
Asylum was rejected (by a first instance decision) in 58 cases and in 35 cases applications for asylum or subsidiary protection were rejected as manifestly ill-
186 This conflict increased the number of migrants from Ukraine, but on the other hand, it precludes migration from the third countries through Ukraine towards western countries.
Migrants are forced to seek other routes.
Concerning human rights violations in 2017, in terms of the right to international protection, two contextual levels can be identified:
2) The migration crisis context: period before the asylum procedure and relocation of asylum seekers to Slovakia.
The analysis also focused on available documents of relevant Slovak institutions and public bodies competent to grant decisions in asylum procedures, responsible for their process or entitled to intervene within asylum proceedings, particularly the Migration Office of the Slovak Republic, the Police Corps and courts.
192 Section 10 and Section 20(2) of the Act on Asylum.
193 Section 8 of the Act on Asylum.
issues related to international protection.
Asylum is granted to an applicant who a reasonable fear from persecution in the country of origin has based on his/her race, nationality or religion, political opinion or membership of a certain social group due to which he/she cannot or does not want to return to this country.
Asylum is also granted to an applicant who is persecuted for exercising his/her political rights and freedoms in the country of origin.
198 Applicant can also be granted asylum for humanitarian reasons199,200 or for family reunification201.
Since provision of asylum is fixed to one of the five reasons, its definition does not cover all cases when a person is forced to seek protection outside the country of origin.
194 Section 2(a) of the Act on Asylum.
200 Section 9 of the Act on Asylum.
201 Section 10 of the Act on Asylum.
Prohibition of discrimination is an underlying principle also in asylum procedures in line with international human rights treaties (e.
g. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Convention on the Rights of the Child and others) and national legislation (Constitution and the Antidiscrimination Act).
Procedural safeguards and rights granted to all migrants irrespective of their legal status must, however, be respected also in terms of these exceptions.
203 Debrecéniová, J: “Antidiskriminačný zákon, komentár" (2008) p. 350.
8.3 Analysis of the Observance of the Right to International Protection 8.3.1 National context in the Slovak Republic
In terms of asylum procedure, the moment of expression of will to get asylum in Slovakia is crucial for determination of the starting moment of the asylum procedure.
In majority of the cases, the persons detained faced administrative expulsion from Slovakia.
Human Rights League aims to promote alternative measures to detention mitigating negative impacts of detention of the family on children.
Its secondary aim is to gain detailed statistical data concerning the age of detained persons.
The Supreme Court of the Slovak Republic issued three rulings concerning international protection in 2017.
In terms of the Slovak legal order, these rulings are particularly significant, since lower courts and administrative bodies deciding on applications for international protection are obliged to observe them.
A substantial fact is whether the applicant states relevant information regarding possibilities to be granted any form of
o On the contrary, it is an obligation of the administrative body in reasonable doubt to gather all evidence available rebutting or challenging credibility of the applicant.
• Judgement of the Regional Court in Bratislava in case 8SaZ/1/2017 of 16 June 2017:
• Judgement of the Regional Court in Bratislava in case 8SaZ/3/2017 of 28 June 2017:
subjective feelings of the applicant in terms of reasonability of fear from persecution as an objective component while not requiring real persecution in the past.
The administrative body shall prove or rebut accuracy of the applicant's statements by irrefutable establishment of exact circumstances regarding the statement of the applicant for asylum or at least by such level of probability that does not cause reasonable doubts about accuracy of the administrative body's opinion.
The first area concerns the lack of will of the Visegrad group to fulfil quota of the relocation schemes aimed at assisting the countries mostly hit by the influx of migrants.
This relates to the protection of the right to asylum, protection from expulsions and observance of the right to dignity and the freedom from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as stated in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
8.4 Good Practice Examples

It concerned a case of a detained applicant for asylum from Afghanistan and her three minor children.
Finally, with regards to the abovementioned ruling, the Centre refers to General Comments No. 22 and No. 23 jointly adopted by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and the UN Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families underlying that immigration detention of children violates their rights.
General Comments of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child serve as authoritative interpretations
218 File No.: 10Sza12/2016, see:
01. The Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic and the Police Corps of the Slovak Republic fully respect their human rights and ensure due observance of international treaties and human rights conventions, particularly the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, in all actions concerning refugees and migrants.
02 The Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic and the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic ensure and respect access to fair, speedy and effective asylum procedure for all applicants for asylum, the right to information, the right to effective remedy and the best interest of a child.
03. The Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic inhibit and prevent inhuman or degrading treatment in relation to detention of migrants and refugees at borders, particularly when it comes to minor migrants and refugees.
04. The Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic desist from the practice of detaining children based on the immigration status of their parents in line with the recommendations of the UN Committee for the Rights of the Child.
05. The Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic guarantee the right to adequate standard of life, education and healthcare to all children of applicants for asylum and/or refugees.
Public bodies and all human rights organisations active in Slovakia cooperate at adoption and implementation of integration programmes for persons seeking or enjoying international protection.
All human rights organisations active in Slovakia stand up against violations of human rights of migrants and refugees, promote tolerance and empathy towards refugees and migrants, including their protection in reception centres and other housing facilities.
All human rights organisations active in Slovakia advocate against suppression of human rights by security measures and borders protection.
All human rights organisations active in Slovakia support national and regional cooperation aimed at human rights protection, provision of humanitarian aid, promote understanding towards refugees and migrants also through media and participate in intercultural dialogue and common activities.
